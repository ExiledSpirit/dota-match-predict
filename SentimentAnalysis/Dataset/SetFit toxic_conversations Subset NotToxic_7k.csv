"Money laundering

INTERPOL's definition of money laundering is: ""any act or attempted act to conceal or disguise the identity of illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources"".
Illegally obtained funds are laundered and moved around the globe using and abusing shell companies, intermediaries and money transmitters. In this way, the illegal funds remain hidden and are integrated into legal business and into the legal economy.
At INTERPOL, we work to combat money laundering through the global exchange of data, supporting operations in the field, and bringing together experts from the variety of sectors concerned. We work closely with other international organizations to foster international awareness of the importance of using financial investigative techniques against organized criminal activities and to avoid duplication of effort."
"Trump's unrelenting attack on the fourth estate (media) is unprecedented....in America. However it was a common ploy used by dictators in Europe over the last 100 years. Destroy the credibility of the media ; blur the lines around fact and fiction; encourage conspiracy theories; and treat any criticism by the media as heresy. 
His performance today was more alarming because the rest of the world seems to have ignored it."
"I remember ""Workfare"" - a model of why rampant socialism should terrify everyone."
HPD reports that much of the violence is directed at native Hawaiians who are loathed for what is perceived as a phony history perpetuated by Hawaiians.  There is an ethnic and racial component to this.   ride the bus a lot and you might be surprised at what Micronesians are saying about the history of Hawaiian slave ownership and the stealing of land in Hawaiin invasions of these islands hundreds of years ago.
"Another example of how ""compromise"" and ""bipartisanship"" have been vilified by both sides and prevent our country from making progress in moving our country forward.  Obama said ACA wasn't perfect and needed adjustments.  The other side had to repeal outright for politics alone, but for 6 years didn't burn many calories on a replacement.  Perhaps prohibiting riders (i.e. pork) has prevented our leaders from making deals with each other (give and take), and we all lose.  Please bring compromise back to politics.  I'm glad Mr. Young can see this."
"When Mr. Garratt took the trouble to be carefully polite to all who might have helped, why did you feel the need to be nasty and partisan??"

"When you buy drugs on the street your faith in ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" sometimes can kill you.  

But, since there has been sufficient time for drug testing and the indictment is for ""unlawful delivery and unlawful possession of methylenedioxymethamphetamine — also known as Ecstasy""  your diagnosis, no matter how much personal use and empirical experience you may have, is suspect."
Is this Kelly's work or Donald's?
"SteelTown2017:  The difference being of course that when Trudeau is finished his um's, he either reads well, from well-written pre-prepared notes, or improvises coherently. Trump blusters like one of those inebriated, boastful, business louts you see sometimes who have lingered on past happy hour, offering unrelated blurts, WWF-style facial expressions, and non-sequiturs that accumulate, until a pattern family does emerge: each comment is designed to prove how amazing he is.  The styles could not be further from ""being on par."""
Well... now girls can join the cub scouts while boys are still prohibited from joining girl guides. Maybe this will help things later on down the road... eh Elizabeth?
"<<Now, if you don't mind, can you please explain to me what this has to do with anything?>>
I take it you didn't read the NCR article, the thread, or the article I cited. It would help to read them."
And this relates to the story at hand how?
"Behind home world there is a ton of trash stacked up, and tents line the path on both sides. It's a mess and you have close calls every time you pass through there."
"To follow on on from point 2 I wonder what the number of people hacked to death with panga's is in SA? I agree that the two scenario's that are compared are hardly comparable when you get down to the essentials. Of course the gun made the Phillipi killings much easier for the murderer(s) but I wonder whether some sharp objects would simply not have been used if no guns were available? 

On enforcement of the FCA I think there are two sides to the story. It depends on who you are dealing with. Some SAPS members are obviously hell bent on enforcement while others take a more realistic approach. The current court process around the validity of the FCA renewal provisions shows up the poor drafting of the Act . It stems from the not so well hidden aim of the Act to deprive owners of their property if they haven't complied with the letter of the law, leaving no room for condonation. Lets see what the Con Court says..."
"Yes, but Obamacare was the last nail in the coffin."
"Work Farce:

Your point regarding the need to be aware of the costs and consequences of the First World War is valid. However, you generalize to the point of absurdity when you make a statement such as ""that Germany was immediately determined to wage a war of revenge (WWII)."" 

What is ignored is twenty years of German domestic politics and developments in international affairs, all of which could have produced a much different outcome. Decisions made in Berlin, London, Paris, Moscow, Washington, Rome, and all the other major seats of power - including Geneva, home of the League of Nations , and New York, centre of world finances - all had a bearing on how the world shaped itself after the treaties were concluded in 1919.

At first glance, history appears to be written by the victors. Look deeper and you will find that there is a chorus of voices, both nuanced and bombastic, on such subjects. Expect more as we approach the centenary.

I'm a trained historian, but only one voice."
"No kidding, and yet with the little cash they may have had, the dude was spending it on himself at the Bronco game."
"Dixon's letter is a bunch of drivel.  FOXNews has surely helped advance the nation's cause, hasn't it?  I refuse to jump to conclusions, and will wait to see what happens before I get excited.  This is an example of the media's doing its best to agitate."

"Michael:  I saw the Hobby Lobby ""advertisement of faith"" and simply chose not to read it.  That's an option which was available to everyone.  

I think the Hobby Lobby owners have every right to hold and express their religious/political beliefs, including spending their money to have them published in newspapers.  You and I express our views and beliefs with Letters to the Editor.  Ironically, that Hobby Lobby ad helped pay for the Letters to the Editor feature which allowed you to condemn the ad and the RG for publishing it.  Sometimes it's amazing how that First Amendment works.  

You and I may both feel that full-page statement of faith was bunk.  We have the right to feel it was and to say it was.  That's a reflection of the same freedom which protects the H-L folks right to have it published.    Question for you Michael:  How would the RG's refusal to print this ad be different from the bakery refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex marriage?  Let me know...regards, Gary"

"Taking care of sick people will never be profitable, this is the fundamental reason free market health care will never work. Comparing LASIK, a voluntary procedure, to rounds of chemotherapy or treatment for MS is absurd. The idea that ""choice"" is key makes sense only for healthy people seeking elective procedures. What choice is there is your kid has cancer? Millions of dollars in care or they die. What if they need a kidney transplant? The problem is that people can move from ""healthy"" to ""in dire need of care"" in a literal heartbeat. I've watched healthy active friends be diagnosed with cancer and ALS in their 20's, without insurance they would simply die. Full stop. No one can save enough or clip enough coupons to pay for that treatment. Pretending that people get sick because they have no financial motivation to stay healthy, or that the issue is voluntary treatment, is absolute nonsense. Not to mention the absurd costs you incur when older, that are paid forward by insurance."
"I think our government needs to step back and concentrate on maintaining what we already have, Look at the state capital for god sakes! they can't even maintain the moat which surrounds the state capital, its a green algae mess! You people think A/C units in classrooms will get any maintenance, our government can't even maintain the current life style they created for themselves let alone trying to make life cushy for our public school kids. Most of our government workers can't even afford their own household A/C system, and those who have A/C are afraid to use it in fear of breaking themselves with high electric bills. I submit to all of you that Its a luxury left to those who can afford it. Like private schools, Porsches, Tesla's, etc. Ask yourself  ""WHO WILL PAY FOR IT"". You think your poor now, heheh, were in over our heads and our government put us there! And the way our government bites the hand of the republican administration in DC, you'll see no federal support come to Hawaii."
"I give him next to no credit at all. Winters rarely tackles the substance of arguments but goes in for ad hominem attacks, usually against good, holy bishops like Cardinal Burke - and stirs up hatred against him and other good priests and faithful. I bet he's never even met the Cardinal but sees himself qualified to judge his heart. That isn't Christian by any measure. I say this in all charity: his screeds add absolutely nothing to building up the Church and are (rightly) ignored by practically everyone."
"Well, DIA for one has 6 runways, all of which can handle a 747. Keep in mind that LAX (e.g.) only has 4 runways total if you need perspective. Also, no runway at DIA intersects another runway. This can't be said for such airports as San Francisco and Chicago O'Hare to name a few. Did I mention that DIA is the most modern airport in the United States? I think we have it covered here Harpro, thanks bro."
"From reading this article, it sounds like HA overreacted but there must be more to the story than what's been reported.  Turning the plane around and having to dump it's fuel isn't a decision they would make lightly."
"I strongly disagree with the assertion that Hawaiians/Kanaka Maoli do not get involved (""visits or cares"") until someone proposes some alternative use for the parcel.  On the contrary, Hawaiians are actively involved - it's only when the land use takes a drastic shift that Hawaiians then take to drastic measures in opposition.  

More often than not, the land at issue is agricultural land, which is later slated for rezoning and eventually urban development.  In a natural state, the land still possesses cultural value for Hawaiians.  Obviously, the same cannot be said when urban development levels a parcel and wipes out all traces of Hawaiian existence. 

If a parcel of land, covered with ancient Hawaiian archaeological sites, is left alone to grow grass, then the likelihood of those sites being disturbed is at minimal.  Clearly, that likelihood increases by leaps and bounds when a developer proposes to turn the parcel into a golf course or subdivision."

"On the one hand, the power of money to corrupt the institution is extraordinary. On the other hand, the good works of the Knights at the parish level is also extraordinary.  Canon law calls lay Catholics to challenge our bishops when we see their leadership is false.

"And remember what happened to Carter.  Eminently sensible and shot right down.  Yes, a buck was a buck, and the buck stopped before any significant amount of it was implemented.  In the end, any tax reform has winners and losers and you hear a lot of bitching from the losers.    

And taxes are not just to collect money to run the country (as distinct from paying for government services, which is a classic argument of the rich against paying based on their ability to pay).  The welter of taxes and tax exemptions are there to encourage some behaviours and discourage others.  Every oddity and wrinkle of the tax system was put there for a reason.  For instance, the favourable treatment of dividends from Canadian corporations is there to encourage Canadians to invest in Canadian companies.  Take it away and a lot of money would flow out of the Canadian stock market and into other countries.  And so on.  

Simplifying is a great idea until you look at the oxen that would be gored.

"Our repeated impass is your--and it is YOUR--inability to acknowledge that someone who doesn't uncritically accept your dogmas can nonetheless be reconciled with their Creator.

ALL salvation by any name and in any language you choose is ENTIRELY the product of Rah'matullah--God's Mercy.  None attain it for themselves.  The 'good works' you dogmatically attempt to exclude from the salvation-equation constitute expression of GRATITUDE for God's Mercy.  And yes, it's expected. God dislikes ingratitude.  He expects us to express it by obeying His Laws and seeking to do what pleases Him.

You should know better than to trot out that tired 'salvation by good works' accusation. Both it and its corresponding 'faith-not-works' fallacy courtesy of the Impostor Paul is refuted in your own scripture by the Disciple James (rah'matullahi alayhi): 

""Know ye not, O foolish man--faith without works is DEAD?"" (James 2:20)

Nor are moral people only found in the 'prevailing' culture you seem to prefer, and only someone seeking to exalt themselves above others would take such a position (which is by definition immoral).

The other fallacy is that ONLY western culture is capable of invention and innovation.  You fall victim to the logical fallacy of confusing (and/or conflating) military 'superiority' and the economic largess derived therefrom with cultural, moral, ethical, spiritual and intellectual superiority.  You are of course wrong as hell.  All your vaunted 'superiority' constitutes is that your society is better at killing.  That's always a temporary situation."

Your numbers are mostly accurate but 2006 and 2007 were actually surpluses of 13.8 and 9.6 billion. I'm sure you remember that those deficits were tied to the global economic meltdown - and that the NDP wanted Harper to spend MORE and the Liberals wanted to spend it FASTER. NO ONE said they should spend LESS. Harper promised to get back to a balanced budget - and he did. Now take a look at where we are today - deficits three times as large as promised with the AG saying there is no end in sight until 2050 - and no plan to get there. And you're happy about that?
Poor decision.  Let Nature takes its own course.
"Nice article,
How about the following.
We could have spaces conveniently placed, developed by the state, where people can sell what they can create at home or access where ever.
These need not be expensive to generate as all that is required, in its most basic iteration, would be parking and basic structures from which to peddle ones wares.

So that I can make what ever I can at home and easily go and sell it.
or with my vehicle go to the big market and sell the produce at the local market.

The big retailers of our world may not like it, but I am sure they could adapt and anyway the system is supposed to be based on the idea, of open entry to the market.

Instead of having metro cops harassing people trying to sell goods, they should be facilitated.

This could in turn generate production hubs.

We need to start by coming up with practical measures that can be introduced tomorrow."

Enough is enough with Mrs. Vasquez, my vote is for Grenn.

"The atrocious mismanagement of the electricity sector continues. Shifting tens of billions of dollars in waste and overcharges to further in the future or from ratepayers to taxpayers is pointless. It was the idiots of the last decade that voted Liberal, so why should people even after the 20-year span of the contracts pay for these mistakes? Unless the Liberals raise taxes again, or add another new tax, taking funds from the general budget only means more debt, so again, it's future Ontario that pays.

The only solution is to legislate changes to the contracts. This strategy has been validated by the courts already; the Ontario government has the right to do so. Many of the (Liberal) people who profited from the ridiculously overpriced contracts have already paid off the cost of their ""investment"" (some after five years or less of 20-year contracts), so to unilaterally change the contracts from 80c/KWH or 35c/KWH to a more reasonable 15 or 12c/KWH would be perfectly justifiable."

"1/6  You have certainly raised an interesting issue and I’ve put quite a bit of time into it before answering you. This is really not a Catholic issue; the majority of Christians hew to the same approach Catholics do, even though many of the liberal sects have departed from natural law theory to justify other things they are doing. Small sects hew to your approach, and conscientious objection is a minor but serious component of American beliefs.

First, the Scriptural references, which I provide with a short commentary from a mainline Protestant commentary - just so we understand this is not a uniquely Catholic view of the texts:

Matthew 5: 43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;"

How can educators ignore media  collusion with the DNC against Sanders, Clinton Foundation donations and access to the State Department.  How can we trust these people when they deceive at every level.  Obama lied about the Affordable Care Act.  He fails to enforce immigration laws and targets the opposition using the IRS.  Obama and Clinton lied about Benghazi.   Their staffers plead the Fifth to avoid telling the truth.  The NSA lies to us.  How can we trust their drone strikes.

"Here are the facts foreign buyers get an automatic 25% discount off the price of a home due to exchange. Vancouver is the second least affordable city in the world primarily due to house prices and although a buyer's tax was put in place and sales have slowed but prices are still up. Vancouver's problem is no land, a problem the Toronto region does not have.

Will a 15% tax help in TO, no as we are only on sale at a 10% off. The first step is stopping the option flippers that are selling a contract without buying the house. Require all accepted offers to be registered on title including assignments of options with the realtor being required to get a clearance certificate from Canada Revenue for each transaction. Increase the capital gains tax on options profits to 80%. As for the foreign buyer that actually purchases a home add a non-occupancy tax if the home is unoccupied for any period over 30 days and require the realtor to register the property with the city as foreign owned."

The Donald is not psychotic, but he is severely neurotic, IMHO. The character flaws you list (incompetent, unprepared, incurious, etc.) are just some of the symptoms. There is a difference between the delusions of a psychotic and Trump's delusions. The core difficulty is that when confronted with a psychotic, most people recognize the condition as mental illness; but with neuroses, opinions vary."

Well you must not be a regular reader of the G&M. Just two days ago as part of the lead up to the Canada day celebration their was a fascinating piece here informing Canadians who hadn't heard that evidently Americans now think it's cool to be stupid. 
In the excitement leading up to a celebration somewhat similar to America's 4th of July, Canada's national newspaper ran on it's 'front page' , top center, that your only neighbors think it's cool to be stupid."

"You are correct on the amount of the costs but wrong about the ignorance of the council: it was fully aware of them but decided to go ahead anyway. I was part of a group that included many prominent architects who (many are retired) had no financial  interest in the issue. Councilor Alan Zelenka was the most vocal cheerleader for the rapid demolition; he appears to have a conflict of interest, at least implied: he has close ties to the local purveyors of high-energy efficient technology (read very expensive and somewhat untried). He also misrepresented the condition of the ""old"" City Hall, repeatedly."
"That's fascinating.  If you're a Christian you must know the Bible.  Biblical prophecy says that the destruction of the earth will come about through humans enacting the will of Satan.  It says that the trees will burn, the oceans will die, that men will faint in terror at the storms, among other things like pestilence.  It also says that if God had not stepped in, there would be nothing left alive on earth.

One of my favorites is from Job: 

""Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?""
Job 38:22-23

Another from Daniel says that knowledge will increase and the people will be highly mobile, unlike anything ever seen before.

The war is the war for the earth, which Satan hates because it is God's creation, but it is also a spiritual war.  If you're not with God's creation, you're on the wrong side."

Since when is it acceptable for your ""citizens of conscience"" to join a cause that summarily beheads prisoners en mass and conducts the genocidal slaughter and sexual enslavement of an entire ethnic group (Yazidis)?

Our troops are currently aiding in that fight, as part of a legitimate multi-national operation, at the request and invitation of the local government. Should these people ever return, they should expect to be taken into custody and face very serious criminal charges with a suitably long period of incarceration for being part of a recognized terrorist organization and engaging in armed conflict against Canada. They would also need to be investigated in detail for any culpability in specific cases of murder, torture and slavery."

That would simply lead to a ""whole lot"", ""some"", ""a little"", ""virtually none"" debate...There's no resolution to such a debate.  The real issue is a foreign nations ACTION and INTENT to influence the internal politics of another nation.  As I point out, we have been, time and again, guilty of doing just that.

I wasn't alive during the Roosevelt Administration but knew many who were and appreciated his efforts to put the country back to work and the civic works that resulted. (Consider the price of electricity in the Pacific Northwest) I was certainly alive and politically active during Viet Nam however. Everyone was either for or against. Nobody was on the fence. There was no need for the KGB to inflame antiwar sentiment. LBJ and Nixon did that just fine all by themselves."

Absolutely NOT - remember that in those days the urban poor were regularly gaoled or strung up for minor offences of desperation - e.g. stealing gloves to survive .... Or bonded into service to pay for their passages. The rich/poor divide was the size of the Grand Canyon - the nobility and Church a tiny percentage who exploited the common people. England may have been the worst, France had the French Revolution, there was the Irish Potato Famine, Russian serfs in name only - actually slaves.
The story of urban slum life just prior to and during the Industrial Revolution makes for horrifying reading. I would use the tem ""criminal"" with a large grain of salt, actually never. And ""sociopaths"" is truly a stretch  .-(

Compared to where Nixon sent 13 high school classmates, prison was a resort, and I saw the worst parts of it, including the Hole at McNeil Island. If all those presidents who have taken innocent lives were in prison the world would be a better place, but funerals for other sociopathic world leaders wouldn't be so well attended.

"RTH: when you say that “they admit that not one vote was changed by the Russians,” you are repeating a popular but totally false Republican talking point.

The January 6, 2017 consensus report by U.S. Intelligence agencies, titled “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution” very specifically states that the agencies DID NOT investigate whether votes were changed. The agencies, which you refer to as “they,” did not “admit” anything about the changing of votes. Here’s exactly what the report said:

“We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.”"

This on top of the fact that, cost-wise, it is way more expensive to process recycled materials in the United States than abroad"
"I believe the author shows his own bias (which is natural, of course) when he insists that mass attendance ""fulfills a divine command."" Does he derive this from a protracted understanding of the 3rd commandment?

I certainly fit the mold of ""skeptic"" in terms of his idea of mass being a ""sacred obligation,"" especially where he presents as ""fact... that it's offensive to God if they deliberately choose to ignore him""--as if tending to an elderly parent (for one example) would be a poor way to keep holy the Sabbath. To keep holy literally means to ""set apart."" Other than tradition in the early church (the earliest of whom attended house gatherings--not mass--incidentally), there are no ""facts"" that command mass attendance and/or that it is offensive to God to honor Him in other ways... not suggesting that mass attendance is bad but ""sacred obligation"" seems a stretch."

I guess it's going to take a nuclear warhead just 10 minutes inbound on a ballistic trajectory onto Oahu to convince him that his 1960's flower-child view of the world just doesn't protect our islands in the 21st century.   I guess all those concessions and millions of dollars of aid we funneled into North Korea since the 1990s wasn't enough to prove to Mr Lind America is trying to relieve tensions on the Korean pensisula--for South Korea's sake if none other.  I guess our withdrawal of American forces in Korea to a secondary, reserve force, allowing Koreans to defend their own pensiula, wasn't enough to convince our cumbaiyah-signing journalist we're serious about changing our status on the peninsula.  No, when you're lost in the hippy mind set of the 60's, America is always the enemy,"
"1 - the cars do not need road sensors to operate. Companies like Here are building a massive database with very precise road data collected by many thousands of cars that (in some cases unknown to their drivers) are recording road details down to a matter of inches. Tesla cars already have data that modifies speeds of cares in cruise control to adjust for upcoming tight curves etc. Not yet perfect but the data is accumulating very fast.
2 - the sensors and cameras that you are referring to are used to divert cars (whether autonomous or human-driven) along the quickest route based on real time traffic flow. We already have that technology in use and much of that infrastructure is privately built.
A third point (from the article, not your post) - the Tesla that crashed was not an autonomous car, the setting in use was intended to be supplemented by human observation and reaction. The driver failed, not the system."

"People with access are paid considerable sums of money whether there is an immediate return or not. That is how Harper and John Baird got onto Easy Street.

Manafort and Gates have connections to Russia and both end up on Trump's campaign team until Manafort got caught out. Donald Trump Jr and others have stated how much of the Trump empire's financing comes from Russia. Now we have the Russian-connected campaign team members for the Russian-financed Presidential candidate and we have Russians in possession of emails embarrassing to Hillary Clinton. It doesn't sound like Manafort and the Russians did the Democrats any great favours! So, do you think Dubya was being influenced by the Russians, he was still in power in 2006?"

He was a scoundrel with women, but he also signed several pieces of conservative legislation, and reached across the political divide. A tough crime bill, the Defense Of Marriage Act, a law cleaning up welfare, but today, to find a Democrat like Mr. Clinton who could unite us as a nation, or a Republican like Mr. Reagan, is very rare.
Your point on both parties being corrupted is well taken, they are. They are the goose and the gander , birds of the same feather in many ways, Both owned by money, both serve big money corporate and individual, money is their key to power, not the common man who their only need for is a vote. I truly loved seeing Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump both turn away the Koch brothers, Wall Street, and big money, today that is most refreshing. Although I voted for Mr. Trump, (supreme court), Mr. Sanders was the most honest of the 3, but I don't vote socialist"
"I think you just proved all my points. 

I'm not a Muslim but I'm sure one could step in and give the same sort of theological reasoning for why the vast majority of Muslims do not read those violent verses literally. And, you can't make special pleading for the terrorists who blow up abortion clinics.

The fact is that the vast majority of Muslims are people like you who treat their religion and faith as a source for good in their life. They are well-meaning people who promote peace and love above any of the darker aspects of their religion's texts or history. The fact that you can't see that is the problem. 

Another fact is that Muslims are often the target of violence from people who view them as potential terrorists. Muslim's are also the biggest target of terrorist organizations - by far. So when you say a Mosque opening up increases the chance Jihad shows your utter fear-based bigoted outlook on a major world religion."

"Thank you, News Times, for your continuing, balanced reporting of this topic.  

For many, the Wrights Crossing's proposal for building 1500 houses on active farmland outside of the City's UGA is a non-starter with numerous (and appropriately) fatal flaws. The driver for this JPA expansion is clearly the City's desire to enable the development. Is endorsing the JPA engagement endorsing Wrights Crossing, but merely more indirectly than approving the developers application?  Both the proponents and opponents of the development can agree on one point:  of course the JPA discussions are a pathway for it.  So, does voting yes on the JPA imply yes on Wrights Crossing?  

We believe that Wright's Crossing presents a deeply false choice of housing verses agriculture.  We support both.  We strongly encourage the Commissioners to reject Wrights Crossing, and to make clear that the JPA is not a back door into it.  Time and effort much better spent.   

Thank you for the opportunity to comment."

I have a 10,000 lb winch on the front of my truck with a snatch block to move stuff around.   These days there are only a few landings open for cutting firewood, and they are usually quite a ways away.  Nowadays,  I just call my logging friend in Lorane who lives on 800 acres of solid flat timber land.  He also has a backhoe, and a Cat 550 dozer with winch.  Firewood life  is good.

Not that this is the point, but I worked in a behavioral health center, and even for our involuntary patients, they still are allowed an amount of autonomy that they can refuse treatment.

Civil rights cannot demand medical treatment unless very specific arguments are made. 

But the point being the first step is that they are safe and the streets are safer. And yes, you are right. The welfare of the community is important. Was this not adddressed in the plan?"

However, across the board percentage cuts are not an intelligent approach. Such approaches show nothing but a lack of leadership and a total inability or unwillingness to evaluate spending on a program-specific basis and subsequently assign priorities for spending. Across the board cuts reflect cowardice and laziness, taking the easy route out. They do major damage to all programs, including the ""good"" ones, and give continuing life to programs that should be either eliminated or cut back. Individual citizens will always have different points of view. Is that not why we elect leaders to work through it all and make good decisions for the greater good?"

"There are good reasons why no state awards their electors proportionally.

The whole number proportional system sharply increases the odds of no candidate getting the majority of electoral votes needed, leading to the selection of the president by the U.S. House of Representatives, regardless of the popular vote anywhere.

It would not accurately reflect the nationwide popular vote; 

It would reduce the influence of any state, if not all states adopted. 

It would not improve upon the current situation in which four out of five states and four out of five voters in the United States are ignored by presidential campaigns, but instead, would create a very small set of states in which only one electoral vote is in play (while making most states politically irrelevant), 

It would not make every vote equal. 

It would not guarantee the Presidency to the candidate with the most popular votes in the country."

So, why not get more creative?  Demolish all Honolulu's pre-1974 75-foot-plus condo highrises and replace them with even denser structures of units entirely for affordable and homeless tax programs.  This mayoral policy of the ""greater good"" creatively extends the city's viability with a comparatively fewer being sacrificed.  Historically, the City condemned private royal trust lands for private owners.  With this precedent, why not now condemn condo buildings for the greater good?   Homeless and affordable housing issues are high risk components and so must be as great emergencies for the city as sprinklers are for private condo owners.   You go Mr. Mayor!"

Safeway worked because often it was the only game in town or had better locations and hours than the competition.

Teachers have a right to organize and advocate for their interests. That includes supporting candidates.  Anti-union, anti-teacher folks are also free to organize as a countervailing force to influence politicians, electing those who agree with you, defeating those who don't. You know, ""democracy."" The Republican Party, Chamber of Commerce, etc., attempt to do that. But the Dems and HSTA have more public support.

You  misstate FDR's views. He did NOT oppose public sector unions. He said their conditions were different from the private sector, which limited their collective bargaining rights and they should not employ ""militant tactics,"" like a strike, against the public. In a letter congratulating a public sector UNION for existing for 20 years. He said they had no right to strike, not no right to exist."

"Mr. Ryan,
Many rural school districts do not have the population to support the tax base to pay teachers more. Many rural school districts have what in other areas would be considered substandard buildings -- by which I'm not talking about a lack of heated Olympics-sized swimming pools, I'm talking about buildings with structural issues -- but can't afford new ones.
Conejos County has a population of 8,100.
Huerfano County has less than 7,000 residents.
I bet there are city blocks in Denver or in its suburbs that have more people living in high-rise apartments or condo/apartment complexes.
Those counties can also feel isolated and cut off during bad weather.
How would you address those issues?
Merely stating (whining about?) what you apparently feel is an insufficient salary doesn't resolve those issues.

The Democrats pushed their vote % in places like Philadelphia...winning a seat with 90% of the vote, counts the same as 51%.

Canada? You could win 175 seats (majority) crafted from the lowest population seats, and only get say 40% of the vote in each. Simple math says that you could fashion a ""majority"" government from something like 17% of the votes cast.

(say the bottom 175 in pop have around 40% of the total pop, and you win each of those seats  with 40% of the votes cast - 40% being a typical win in a 3+ candidate riding. Voila - a 16 - 17% ""majority"". In fact, even today, take out the seats a government doesn't win, they are ruling with a small % of the votes cast - even far less than the sub - 40% majorities Canada typically gets. )"

It is one thing to get upset when a foreign hot shot comes in and gives unwanted advice but its not a good or honest strategy to accuse them of not knowing what they're talking about. Fonda was very sympathetic towards oil patch workers and what McMurray has endured  also citing the fires and floods occurring in California as being part of climate change.

Anybody who has traveled shared services from Prudhoe has seen the mass exodus directly to flights outside.  The oil rig tied to the Homer dock has a 100% outside crew.  The large crew doing seismic on the peninsula is 95% from outside.  The state is paying 55% or more in tax credits to fund a bunch of jobs for outsiders.  This is the main reason I support an income tax over a sales tax.   Itinerant workers would be paying part of it.  A sales tax hits me for heat and food and everything.  I agree with Mr. Pendergrast that the Republican majority owns this current budget crisis.  There is not a fiscal conservative in the bunch.

Ross  was primarily a case about the ""poisoned educational environment"" created by his off-duty anti-semitic writings and other activities - as the excerpt I quoted above indicates.  Which means a high degree of relevance to this California school case.

""The school is an arena for the exchange of ideas and must, therefore, be premised upon principles of tolerance and impartiality so that all persons within the school environment feel equally free to participate.  As the Board of Inquiry stated, a school board has a duty to maintain a positive school environment for all persons served by it."""

"I didn't take her to be trashing the Gates foundation.

She points out how the deck is stacked against the poor, and particularly women of color.  I didn't get that she thought they shouldn't have access to birth control. Rather, it seemed that she thought they should have access to humane employment, child care, health care, housing, educational opportunities, and the whole range of social goods that women of greater means enjoy, as they build and nurture their own families. Access to birth control alone is insufficient. The idea that the greatest impediment to the well-being of the poor is their own fertility is a falsehood that lets the privileged off the hook. There is a lot more than birth control that everyone should have access to. At least, that's how I read it."

One doesn't irrigate tiny shoots of corn with gravity flow irrigation. The corn has to be tall enough to not drown. Then there is this, which even a city person should have thought through: ""He had spent the winter using borrowed tractors to plant corn, alfalfa and wheat on about 300 acres.""

"If the problem were access to guns violence would be evenly distributed among people with legal access and concentrated among those with the most money to buy yhem. That isn't thr case. Instead, violence is concentrated in areas with the hardest legal access among prohibited possessors.

It's a problem of a subculture of violence, preying primarily on itself, who are accessing guns via already illegal means that no proposed legislation can be shown to have a chance of effecting. Blaming guns, much less legal access to them, is both puerile -and- distracts from addressing the actual root social and cultural causes of violence."

"People really need to quit beating around the bush on these issues.  Truth be known, the bottom line is which group is better funded and better connected.  The group which believes in development of resources,  or the group which desires to protect the entire planet from man and his activities.  Obviously the loudest and most politically connected, is the environmental lobby.

As one poster said, think globally, not locally.  Local people are not capable of knowing what is best so they need to be controlled  from afar by Government.  I do agree to a point that some people are more concerned with having a job, earning a living and supporting their families and communities than worrying about someone in New York City driving a hybrid car rather than a gas engine.  

But the locals really do not matter to the environmental protection crowd because really, the world would be so much better off if it were not for all of the people needing air, food,  houses, clothes.  They just need welfare"

He taught THE NEW SACRIFICE OF THE NEW COVENANT, of which Malachi, one of the twelve prophets, had signified beforehand: [quotes Mal 1:10-11]. By these words He makes it plain that the former people will cease to make offerings to God; BUT THAT IN EVERY PLACE SACRIFICE WILL BE OFFERED TO HIM, and indeed, a pure one; for His name is glorified among the Gentiles.

"Mr. Whitehouse and Mr. Durbin both knew that Mr. Browder could not link Fusion GPS and Russian funding. As attorneys, they both knew not to ask a witness a question to which they didn't already know the answer. Both gentlemen were attempting to have a witness on the record admit that there was no link between Russia and Fusion GPS and the Trump dossier. Therefore, this is one more reason to prevent the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, from looking into Fusion GPS funding, which could prove very embarrassing to Democratic interests.

Ordinarily no one interferes with drones in  international waters when they're used for scientific or commercial purposes.

"Source:  Look up Diefenbaker's National Oil Policy, 1961, which created a protected market for Alberta's oil industry.  All provinces from Ontario west paid above market-prices for Alberta oil for about 10 years to support development of Alberta's young oil sector.  

Because Quebec and Atlantic Canada have easy access to oil by sea, they were exempted from the NOP and continued to buy oil in international markets.  The expense of an oil pipeline east was considered foolish.

The spike in global oil prices in the early 70s then gave rise to the NEP, when government wanted to pay Alberta less than market prices to help even out the price shock.  But as we know, Alberta was suddenly all about free markets, and any attempt at a made-in-Canada oil policy pretty much ended with the epic NEP dust-up."

"I'm disappointed.  The Post is leaving out the biggest beneficiary of occupational licensing: politicians.  See, in exchange for writing occupational licensing laws, industry associations write politicians big campaign contribution checks, which inevitably favor the incumbents who write the laws.

Without occupational licensing the opportunity for graft drops, reducing the likelihood that the incumbent politician will be reelected.

So occupational licensing laws have a moral side too: Even if it saves the reelection campaign of just one politician, aren't licensing laws worth it?"

As for ""what do roads have to do with global military strategy"", you kind of need them to invade your neighbors as Russia has done many times in the last 100 years, but despite the abundance of roads between the US and Canada, we haven't been invaded in over 200 years.."
"I feel like someone close to me has died. I recently spent a month in Italy, and met many people from all over Europe.  The first thing they wanted to know about was Trump.  They were rightfully terrified.  They are afraid of NATO and the European Union breaking up, and the people from Poland were especially afraid because they are so close to Russia.  This is a disaster.  I am further terrified, if I can believe what I have read, that Steve Bannon is being considered as Trump's Chief of Staff; and that the AG from Kansas, Kobach, whose goal is voter suppression, is already on board.  The anarchists will be in charge.  The ultra religious who are posting here say that God needs an evil person to carry out his plan.  The insanity is breathtaking."

A lack of empathy that monumental is outlandish.  The Japanese were forced from their homes and locked up behind barbed wire until 1946.  Does Kay really think that flying across the ocean, watching movies and being served beverages, food and snacks is like losing everything and being relocated to the desert?  It is this same sort of oversimplification and overreaction that causes so many people to go crazy over the buffoonery that spews from the mouth of the buffoon in the White House.

With little reason to believe that will change. No one likes to lose. I have played on teams in tournaments where because of stupid seeding rules it was a smart move for us to throw a couple games.

Actually the point is correct, and your explanation indicates a lack of understanding the difference between wishful thinking and market realities.

First, a substantial number of single-family homes _would_ have been rezoned to allow conventional apartments and similar condos.

Second. the market doesn't support redevelopment with family-friendly, workforce housing in close-in residential areas. The market drives higher-cost housing, regardless of form, including single-family redevelopment, so-called ""missing middle"" and apartments and condos. (Note that ""condos"" can include forms other than ""apartment-like."")

Third. R-1 already allows ADUs on R-1 lots, as well as duplexes (some of which already exist) in the current single-family area.

"Sixth - Snatch $2.4 trillion in cash from the world's billionaires (assuming that wouldn't crash the worldwide economy ... which it would) and divide it among the 99%ers in the US (about 319 M people) and we all walk away with a one-time payment of - $7,500. Yeah, that's all of it.

Seventh - And, of course, that's only a one-shot deal. Medicare for All will require $10,000 per recipient for every year going forward,  increasing as time goes on. Tax burden increases on all of us and pretty soon we're all paying 50%-60% and then the government starts reducing available medical care quality to cut costs ... as they do in other countries now.

So, it's not that I think you should have to be rich to afford medicare care. It's that I think medical insurance -- if it exists at all -- should conform to economic reality and I think I'd rather have access to actual medical care rather than pay for placebo medical insurance.

It's not about a lack of compassion. It's about understanding reality."

"An exceptionally incisive, on point column concerning our attempted tilt from the US to China by a 30 year plus career diplomat who was recently our ambassador to China and knows what he is talking about.

Trudeau, as he notes, is naive.  And I would add also intellectually shallow,  inexperienced and simply unsuited to negotiate any kind of trade or other international deal with seasoned, smart, focused pros such as are found among the Chinese rulers.  The Chinese will play Justin like Don Messer used to play the fiddle if we get into protracted, in depth negotiations with China.   

Freeland,  McCallum and career diplomats will try to reign in Trudeau's dumber impulses and prevent  egregiously one sided deals great for China and punitive for Canada but there is much danger that Justin will over rule them to Canada's detriment. 

Our left wing government and media's  animosity toward Trump and the US and increasing veneration of communist China are puzzling and naive and worrisome."

"The Canadian government is not noted for proactive management on the lumber file. When the Americans cannot build homes because there is no lumber, political hell is in store for Washington. If the U.S. decides to add a 20% levy on Canadian lumber, then the short term solution is for the Canadian government to intervene by creating a serious shortage,one way or another, so that the political pain would be a serious detriment to the 20% levy on Canadian-sourced lumber. One way to do this would be to put an equivalent levy on the exports, so the cost of building would shoot up. Fast. Also why should the Yanks get all the money? The levy could be used to compensate displaced workers, compensate the industry, stockpile lumber, etc. But by putting up the cost of construction in the U.S. their housing industry would suffer dramatically, and job losses would be on the table. Oh dear!"

The EC/popular vote discrepancy is a result of the interplay of all those factors and, IMO, reflects those many factors, not some genuine flaw in the EC system."

His Republican Guard was giving up to supply troops in Desert Storm.  Many dictators are full of it.  Kim may turn out to be just another one of those.  Or, he might be nuts enough to actually try something, but I'd bet there are some around him who would either put him on a short leash or even take him out.

"When I was a computer science student 15 years ago at UofT, computer science was predominantly male (25% of female students sounds about right), and top of the class was even more predominantly male. Back then, graduate schools were focused on recruiting female students to help the field become more diverse, so it's not the lack of opportunities.

 If I fast-forward to today, about half of the female computer science students I knew left the field, largely because the opportunities in the fields they left for were better.

 From what I here, there is less computer science students now that there were 15 years ago. Where will all these female CEO's come from?"

Finally, as you seem to think we should not keep 'throwing away the key':  Are you aware of the simple fact that for the last decade or so the majority of Americans believe sentencing has been to lenient and that we 'should' 'throw away the key,' (Check the numbers in Polling Report is you are not aware).

In an editorial today, the New York Times attributes the Republicans' reversal to this phone campaign, rather than to Trump's lone tweet.

As regards ""whites"" I really personally think any thought, policy, philosophy that still insists on skin colour as a defining characteristic is doomed to fail; being just plain wrong in principle. SA is typical; does anyone seriously believe that in a country where the ""black"", 80% or more, majority have been in complete power (putting in place legislation etc that is used limit the power of other race groups) for more than 20 years that ""whites"" control anything significant?

They consulted with the physicians & the pharmacists in the area, & the protocol was voluntarily adopted within a month or so.

And then they advised the over forty other communities in Ontario who adopted, & adapted, the protocol to their local situations.

Then they lobbied the local MPP, who submitted a Private Member's bill to the legislature. It received all party support, & was given royal assent in December 2015. And then the wheels fell off.

A quote from a recent G+M story from a RE agent states that ""demand is unlimited"" for Vancouver condos sold overseas. 

This commodification of housing is so entrenched here in metro Vancouver, that it is estimated that 47% of the condos in Richmond city centre are sold and empty, and about 25% of the new condos built at metro Vancouver rapid transit hubs are sold and empty.

"Canada privatized ATC about 20 years ago and having made a dozen or so flights through there as a vfr only pilot, my experience has been excellent.

BTW the cost covers all services except at a few of the very largest Canadian airports  for aircraft under 2 metric tons. A twin engine Piper Navajo is under 2 metric tons as are most of our common single engine acft.)

In retrospect we should have only allowed truly affordable housing to be constructed within a reasonable distance from major employment centers (downtown, Waikiki, Ala Moana, etc) and schools (UHM, Iolani, MidPac, Punahou, Chaminade, etc., etc.) but we did not do that and instead created more affordable housing 2 hours away during rush hours which has left people to commute for 4 hours daily. What would you do about that situation of today? Are you suggesting to demolish the HART portion which has been constructed? I wonder what is the economic cost-benefit of demolition of the constructed portion vs. redesign to take it to other locations? Stopping now is not cost-free."
"""Groking"". Bot that was a good book, timeless! As for Obama's 2 V 8 years, that's true enough. And to date Trump has the mirror image of that. Obama, in his first 2 years did a tremendous amount of damage. Trump in his first 2 years will be hard pressed to undo very much of it but he can try and maybe have some great success. And, at this point, there is no reason to believe that he won't get a 2nd 2 years in 100% control. 

One problem I do have with Trump is that he, like Obama seem to think they have to use tax money to make private business thrive."

"All infrastructure projects take funds that could potentially benefit everyone and give it to a portion of the population. By your logic the H-1 rehab ($42 million) should not have occurred because it did not benefit the windward side, or the H-3 freeway ($1.86 billion in today’s dollars) should not have been built because it does not benefit Ewa residents.

All our infrastructure projects directly benefit only a portion of the island, though we all benefit from them, if indirectly. Rail is no different.

What is different is that H-3 was paid for with 90% federal funds and rail is closer to 15% federal funds. The problem is not that funds are being spent that benefit a portion of the island. Rails problems are ballooning costs, mismanagement, and (unpaid) benefits that developers receive. The problem is that we were sold rail that would bridge two major population centers and what we received was a system that starts in the middle of an empty field and ends where no one wants to go."

From Ballotpedia:  ""A top-two primary is a type of primary election in which all candidates are listed on the same primary ballot. The top two vote-getters, regardless of their partisan affiliations, advance to the general election. Consequently, it is possible for two candidates belonging to the same political party to win in a top-two primary and face off in the general election.[1][2]""https://ballotpedia.org/Top-two_primary

"Comfish chinook quota capped at 300,000 - has been for decades - Pacific Salmon Treaty negotiations now ongoing; 
Sport harvest is 1 - 2 king salmon per day; according to ADFG sport fish log book stats, 2014 angler days was 214,000; that is a potential harvest of 214,000 to 428,000 chinook harvest.
This begs the question - why is the chinook salmon resource dwindling?
The resource cannot sustain this unfettered harvest by the non-resident anglers.
Comfish harvesters are conservation-minded, wanting an abundant resource for the near to long-term future.
Isn't this what all Alaskans want?
The divide and conquer opinion does little to work toward consensus by all users of this valuable resource.

What about the 8000+ visitor riding CO2 spewing jet aircraft all around the globe to get here and then again back home?

At the 2012 IUCN World Conf in Korea, aviation was responsible for nearly 90% of total GHG emissions, and that figure was arrived at by ignoring climate science. For example, the IPCC has estimated that the climate impact of aircraft is 2-4 times the effect of CO2 emissions alone. These extra factors are usually included in aviation CO2 calculations (RF), but IUCN ignored them in 2012?

Will IUCN take the low road again in calculating Carbon offsets needed to be neutral? This issue is thousands of times more important than riding bicycles. 

Let's hope Chad or Nathan look into the issue of aviation CO2-eq (very relevant to Hawaii). This would be journalism, not IUCN PR."

Correct about the general inaccuracy of this years crop of polls. The LA Times/USC poll was spot on with it's numbers which were always 4-6 points higher for Donald Trump than the polls conducted by the rest of the media.  For this they were condemned as being inaccurate or simply being outliers.  Of course you had to be reading the LA Times or Breitbart to have heard about it.

"So, the bishops declined to talk together about Amoris Laetitia.  We, I don't know that I phrased that quite right, but someone decided that they wouldn't talk about it.

Bishop Christopher Coyne of Burlington, Vt., ""chairman of the communications committee of the bishops' conference""  ... ""said the topic was not on the agenda of the executive session at the fall meeting.""  More, the bishops really do not have a venue for this discussion since presentations at the annual meeting are limited to 15-20 minutes.  More,  and I just love this, quoting Coyne and whoever wrote this story: ""There would be a divisive conversation around"" the document because in an open forum it would be very difficult to protect the discussion from ""those who would want to read it one way and those who would want to read it another way.""

That's false.  Either you've confused me with the original poster in this part (conversation) of the thread, or you're being deliberately deceptive.  You made the original accusation of plagiarism in the ""arc of history"" quote without providing any citation or evidence to support it. Ironically, it was I -- not you -- who provided a citation to an article that traces the history of the quote; and that citation appears in my first post to you in this thread.
Your writing is either careless or dishonest; in this instance, anyway, it appears to be careless.

He worked tirelessly visiting inner cities and stops Hillary's team smirked as ridiculous, and in every venue he had massive crowds and delivered the same message of hope and change.

"My trust in CBC was a little bit restored this afternoon after listening to CBC's Cross Country Checkup about Syria and the many problems facing the Syrian people, including non-stop Islamist terrorist attacks against the Syrian people.

Most of the callers clearly had a good idea of the Syria crisis: the real causes, the reality, the problem of western-backed/Saudi-backed Islamist violence/terrorism, etc.

Totally different information from callers to CBC Cross Country Checkup than what we receive in CIA/CBC news/fake-news broadcasts every day.

I think it's time a lot of so-called liberals in Canada and USA admitted that their support for regime-change in Syria, i.e. support for Islamist terrorists such as ISIS and al-Quaida, was based on propaganda...and they (most of them) fell for this propaganda hook, line & sinker. They should be ashamed of that."

They believe and approve of his tweets, forgive the contradictions, believe the only collusion is the rest of the world against Trump, and either tacitly approve of or don't believe his racism. They oppose immigration and immigrants. They oppose regulations to protect consumers and the environment. They approve of Trump's foreign policy interactions.

It's true that the women's march lacked focus and it may, like the 1% protests, fizzle away. But the march did raise real issues. There are plenty of Republicans who will grill any potential Supreme Court justices on their stance on Roe v. Wade and vote for a judge who will further limit access to abortion. For many women, there are already severe limits on access, particularly for poor women who can't easily travel out of red states. If that happens that might give the women who marched the impetus to help bring down the Republicans.

Governor Walker has been willing to offend and be ridiculed by making his proposals, and yet a house of 40 people can't work together enough to solve a huge threat to the state.  Cowards and ne'er-do-wells who have done little to earn the pay they got and more than enough to earn the lack of respect from the Alaska citizenry."
"The majority has sat on their thrones, blocked any idea from minority, ignored pleas from voter and experts (not on lam), pushed mega-million tax breaks for outside oil, fish mining, sued former governor wife, sued person who helped establish state Constitution, lied to voters on SB21, took perky posh trips on state dime, wants to raid every savings to pay for budget at the same time is stalling so they can use Jenkins again along with media to get position held. I goes on and on and on. If we can not have a Republican party loyal to Alaska and it's citizens then we have no state. It's all a lie made to rape our resources and pockets with more taxes to support the wealthy outside. In any supposedly Democratic government that is treason. In N. Korea that's normal business as usual. It is economic slavery everynation on earth has fallen who tried that. Protests, riots complete break down of once powerful countries have imploded on itself. Time line is shrinking."

"So you're saying that someone who is say, a farmer, a mechanic, a rancher, a small business owner, etc. isn't as important as those with a college degree and if they voted for someone then it's because they're dumb and uneducated. We all know how useful those journalism, art history, gender studies degrees are, and how well-rounded and well-educated those who get them are. That is part of the reason why Hillary lost the election - she completely alienated a large segment of people, who although not college educated, are still valuable members of society. So throw out that discriminatory, obnoxious way of thinking and try to see value in others not just based on education."

"With Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as appointed by President Donald Trump, what other kinds of charges could there possibly be but ""Trumped-up charges"" against anyone? 

A prosecutor only has to convince a jury of 12 people; some of whom may very well be one or more of those ""forty million ignoramuses""!

Remember, a jury is largely composed of people not smart enough to avoid jury duty...or sometimes even  those who have hidden agendas."

I'm no fan of his radio stuff (and Moxy was like 20 years ago) but literally no way of handling it would have been deemed acceptable.

"Nope Mr. Crum, we live in different worlds.  If Trump forcibly raped a woman, I would support his immediate imprisonment.  If Trump was shown to have defrauded people through dishonest schemes and lies, he out for me.  The difference in our worlds is that I simply could not care less about words that create no significant causal damage to anyone.  Your world is the PC world where simply thinking or voicing the wrong thoughts is evil.  Never mind substance.  So yes, we are different.  I have only contempt for your PC standards."
"My wife and I, over the years, spent time in Seattle visiting old friends.  We've also spent time in Portland.  Both cities have commercial/retail neighbors with those small, independent, locally owned shops and restauants. Those are the neighborhoods we really enjoyed.   We also enjoy Corvallis, whose downtown (which avoided the disaster of 70s era Urban Renewal) has dozens of those shops.  Broadway in Eugene is, to me, an effort to promote such a downtown. 

 However, for such businesses to be successful, shoppers must actually enjoy walking down the street, ""window shopping"", visiting those shops, and having pleasant exchanges with others who are doing the same.  Given the unpleasant atmosphere in Downtown Eugene today, we ""non-travelers"" are far more apt to avoid the area than to go there.  That's a real shame for everyone involved.  Again, I'm 74 and wish to ""go places"" I find pleasant and be around people I find at least respectful.  that's not today's downtown Eugene."

"This person writes the same drivel every year. His claims appear to be spurious. I could not find any NPR stories related to MRSA and cats. I also looked for a CDC connection between cats and rabies and couldn't find any. He mentions he is a biologist 'by training', which means not by practice. A google search turned up a blogpost mentioning 'a' degree in fisheries biology, so he probably has an unused BS degree. Hardly an expert to be listened to. Rick Sinnott, who is mentioned in this article, actually retired from a career as the state biologist. He seems like more of an expert to me.  I don't know why ADN continues to publish this.

"IRT CaJayBird, Hawaii has an excellent voting system.  There are a few bumps that could be corrected, but we do have an excellent system.  We can start with the Hawaii State Constitution establishing the system, then the establishment of the Office of Elections, the Election Commission, and the Board of Registration all oversee the election process.  I have been involved in the selection of Election Commissioners and they are the individuals, who collectively make certain our election process continues to be the best.  They are bi-partisan and with excellent citizens serving.  Then the polls and poll workers.  I did volunteer to work at the poll to experience the process and to truly understand the voting system.  Hawaii has an excellent system and any opportunity for voter fraud is extremely limited.  My concern is the Federal Law that mandates the States to not purge their voter registration list between presidential elections.  Imua."

You and so many others, truly need to turn off from your daily programming, provided by the likes of CNN, NBC, CBS - and stop taking for granted, what is printed by the WASHINGTON POST, NEW YORK TIMES, CBC, etc, etc.

I have no fear, other than from; yes the undesirable and violent individuals that have been smashing and burning private property, under the pretenses of so-called protesting - and 'they' are protesting an legitimately elected president of 'their' America.

"There are risk-mitigating business reasons for most of these insurance policies owned by corporations.  For instance, the funds may allow business partners to buy the shares from the family of a deceased partner without major disruption to the on-going business.

"Business expenses are deductible whether incorporated or not. The issue is the ability to save hopefully for an adequate retirement. The maximum RRSP contributions will not provide for a retirement equivalent to a retired teacher or firefighter even for someone earning over $200, 000 unless they save additional funds in a non registered account.

So a doctor who starts earning an income at 30, pays off student debt by 35, really only starts saving additional retirement funds after 35 if they live below their means. 

If they get sick they have zero income for 3 months until their long term disability insurance kicks in. This is self funded and costs 5-10 grand a year, and is not tax deductible.
Short term disability is too expensive so most professionals or business owners don't bother. 

The income splitting provisions are reasonable for spouses who in most cases own half the corporations assets (in the event of a divorce)

"I ""get"" the Christian perspective on this story, but these teens need to learn birth control, not abstinence, and parents who place their sons and daughters in abstinence-only environments such as Heritage Academy's are setting their children up for possible tragedy.   Sure -- many, many teens will abstain.   But the reality is that more than a few will not.  Across the planet, among all religions, ""social conservatives"" who couch their views in terms of religious doctrine usually end up twisting that doctrine beyond recognition.  Christianity is about forgiveness, judgment by the Holy Father, not man, and helping others in the times of their greatest need.   See any of that doctrine in this sad story?"

"He's right about paying for good quality employees, unless you want all city workers to be like the surly teen that hates his low paying job at the movie theatre. Perhaps the city could make extra money by not inhibiting zoning and license approvals for the new marijuana industry? A couple million has been seen in other areas, and while ours would be less, it's a start! We could also do well to sue the contractors Sullivan hired to implement SAP and possibly anyone involved in approving them. Black & Veach and Peleton Group (I think, going from memory). The city was paying for weekly airfare to the lower 48, hotel rooms in the captain cook, and all kinds of other extravagant bullflop for those contractors - and they still left the job in a broken, unimplemented state."

He has no, I mean no, political experience except making himself look silly with birtherism. Putin and Kim Jong-un really want Trump to be US President because Trump (""They love me, they just really love me"") is so easily flattered. Trump thinks those two are just great.
There is a grading curve here, Donald Trump being favored on the low end. All he has to do is say something stupid and somewhat controversial to be given a pass. Hillary has to be really aware to sidestep and not be caught in chicanery (fact check) and be at her knowledgeable assertive best just like she was during her 11 hour interrogation by the shuffling, hat-in-hand, egg-on-their-face Benghazi committee. She's tougher by far than Trump, who is subject to the whims of his ill-temper and to his inordinate need for adoration."

"For most people-- the 49% of Americans who get discounted group plans from their employer, plus those who get individual plans on the exchanges that are working, are happy with their plans (not even the Republicans tinkered with this in the end-- businesses and consumers were lobbying for policies and for the tax breaks for employers and employees with the group employer plans). Add to that the people who were happy with Medicaid and the Medicaid expansion and add the Republican and Democratic Governors and legislators who want to retain Medicaid. That means the exchanges (which impact only 17% of Americans) need fixing and the law overall needs fine tuning. There are good ideas for the fix: insurance companies have made statements through their leaders and through material distributed to shareholders on fixing the exchanges and so have doctors and the AMA (disappointed in no attention paid to fixing the exchanges has opposed all of the GOP drafts)."

"Of course it's damaging to the entire community to gut education on any level.   But, good grief, what do you expect when the wealthy top 1% of the population controls and owns everything, or the deciding portion of everything?   
  
   The 1 percent has 35.6 percent of all private wealth, more than the bottom 95 percent combined.
   In 2010, 25 of the 100 largest U.S. companies paid their CEO more than they paid in U.S. taxes. This is largely because corporations in the global 1 percent use off shore tax havens to dodge their U.S. taxes.   
   The corporate 1 percent dominates the lobbying for federal and state policies. In the last 30 years, the ranks of official lobbyists have exploded. In 1970, there were 5 registered lobbyists for every one of the 535 members of Congress. Today there are 22 lobbyists for every member.

As a person of the ""left"" persuasion, I have always viewed Assange as a feminine hygiene product, and am happy to see him rot in the Ecuadoran embassy.

"I like the way the put free speech in quotes, viz ""free speech"". That's their way of indicating that they think it is a bogus concept. Why do Canadians  tolerate their freedoms being constantly whittled away?"

"The 'bloat' is all the corporate welfare.

Cut that and we don't have a revenue problem."
Another desperate attempt to distract from his utterly ineffective first 100 days.
Wrong headline---GCI isn't going to pay anything---it's customers are.
"Perhaps Matson can fix the port authority docks.. since the Municipality can't seem to hire anyone to design it, construct it, and manage the project. See: No more politicians on engineering projects."
Or less. Watch for the self-distruct.
"The Tween Surfer Wannabe racist continues the daily derision of all others of the non-white heritage with the usual redefinition of the term and the usual revisionist history of penthouse occupancy by all of those rich Natives in NY living in the same buildings as the Koch Brothers.  The usual rant devoid of either intelligence, logic, or reason."
"Strange that after 2 days there hasn't been any further detail from any media outlets... especially when one of the women was shot in the initial raid, you'd think there would be something to talk about."
"""children under 14 don’t have the mental capacity to cross the street alone""

I just don't understand how these helicopter parents expect that their children suddenly turn into well-adjusted individuals and not permanently infantilized ""adults"" when they grow up."
"Oh ya folks, don't forget what a pay raise like this does for their retirement pay when that comes around in a few years. The pay of ""X"" years for computation of retirement pay. You wonder why the city is in the crapper & why credit ratings for governments is being downgraded!! Take a hard look. Anchorage needs a leadership that has no political agenda & is in the position to better your city rather then their pocket books. Greedy individuals"
What a waste of time and money. OMG even PTA meetings have an agenda. All show no go.
"Oh come on!  This country will never give the NDP a shot even if Jesus Christ, Ghandi, and Nelson Mandela all merged into one person to lead it!"
"Making pension debt super-priority in bankruptcy and restructuring would go a long way to solve this problem and provide pension security. Under the Wage Earner Protection Program introduced by the Conservative government in 2008/9 normal pension contributions for the year of bankruptcy were granted super-priority status. A good start, but not far enough. Super-priority status should be extended to the entire pension so the pension gets addressed as a high priority whether the company declares bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act or restructures under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. 
Super-priority is one of the few financial terms common in both. Not even secured and unsecured creditors are common."
That conclusion only makes sense if one is so homophobic that they attribute all evil to homosexuality.  The comment to which I responded involved the physical abuse of children by men including Benedict 16's brother.  Being unable to understand one should not abuse a child is a demonstration of a lack of basic morality.  Converting the discussion to an attack on a group of people is a demonstration of bigotry.  And an excellent reminder of the value of the mute feature.
"Again, a posting that advances discussion not a whit.  Worse, a posting that failed to meet peer review more than once, yet was posted again and again in an effort to circumvent the attempt to keep this board civil.  Sigh."
I don't think the calculator works correctly regarding the proposed bill C6. The days spent outside of Canada after obtaining the permanent residency are multiplied by a factor (approximately 1.5) so it increases the required period of staying. Please adjust it. This factor should be 1.0 instead of 1.5.
They should make them build a rickety bridge over the Grand Canyon and force you to cross it in an overweight tractor trailer.

"Someone who couldn't get a long-accepted scientific fact correct is also claiming the vast majority of climate scientists are badly wrong about their field of expertise?
No, got that, thanks."
Liberty is not for everyone.
"But Mr.Hire did bring ideas to the conversation, standard liberal ones. You can do nothing to stop it, and anything you do will be wrong.
Liberal things that are off the list to stop terrorism
Identify who terrorist are by region/race/color/religion/other.
Deny any or all of the above access to places they want to terrorize.

Now clearly, they don't do this because they want terrorist attacks to take place. They do this, because is is not fair non-terrorists who want to come here. I understand where their position. I just don't agree with it."
"Problem with doctors - they are encouraged by drug companies to not 'heal', but prescribe. This one just took it to extremes. Problem with medical industry  - this guy will just go to another state and start it all over again. Who cares if he surrendered his license here. He has another one in AR and will most likely get another one in another state. When people start to realize we do NOT have the best health care in the world and it's NOT just insurance companies, but doctors and hospitals that cause our health care costs to rise, then things can change. But people are so brainwashed that it's all the insurance companies and lawsuits to blame. It's not. It's doctors like these and there are LOTS like this one. My guess the majority."
"Yes, a lack of information, request for explanation, qualify all comments, cast doubt without foundation, these are the proper tactics for Christians whenever anyone accuses a cleric of abuse, even if the accusation is proven in a court of law.  Pope Saint John Paul II, the Great, wrote the playbook on this, and we as True Catholics must follow his lead, don't we, Pandora?"
"This kind of project however, is the only way to get competition back into the broadband market. Comcast holds a near monopoly in virtually every market it ""serves"". These kinds of projects DO work, and bring in business and jobs. For proof of that just look at what happened in Chattanooga, or closer to home, Tacoma."
"Polls show that is not the case. People are upset about the cost, and that is understandable, but again, point that finger at Rene. We would be debating extensions to Millilani at this point if she was a honorable legislator."

Intervened how? You mean the UNITED NATIONS intervention in Kuwait or the UNITED NATIONS measures leading to Israel?
Please have some sympathy for half of the population.
"The traffic on H-1 is turning into a crawl, and eventually impassable, then people will realize they have to get out their cars and use the metro. Last night, I drove from Waikiki to Wahiawa taking me 2 hours to get home. Last Saturday, the motorcycle accident on H-1 in Aiea, also delayed traffic by an hour 1 1/2. Add that to the travel time between Wahiawa and Honolulu, and you are talking about  2 hours plus to get into town. Ridership on the metro will increase once people realize the traffic on H-1 is getting worse and worse as the years go by and they are always stuck in traffic and cannot find any parking. More people using the metro will mean fewer cars on the road and freeways, and will allow those driving to have fewer cars on the roads and freeways. The people on the Leeward side need relief from the daily accidents, stalls, delays on H-1 and Moanalua/ Red Hill freeway, especially during their commutes morning, afternoon and evening. Only the metro will give us the relief."
De-insure it.  Let the doctor have the right to charge what they think their time is worth.  The market will decide what the service is worth.  Just like professional sports.  You'll get what you've pay for.

"The CBO is not non-partisan, the next time they give accurate number will be the first. If Premiums doubled under Obamacare they would necessarily be cut in half by repealing it. If Choices disappeared under Obummercare they would necessarily reappear with a repeal. Let's keep our eyes on the ball. Obamacare was a complete lie from the start and our healthcare was the envy of the world now it's a disaster, we don't want Obummercare replaced we need it repealed and get politics out completely"
Where are they on any 400-series hwy?  The 401 in the GTA is a gong-show.  It's like the OPP just lets anything go - like they've given one big collective shrug.
"Maybe Washington Examiner should be more thorugh before they publish an article. Considering that ULA receives more tax payers money for each launch than SpaceX. ULA and the Air Force is also helping developing the Blue Origin BE-4 and the Rocketdyne AR1 for use on ULAs new Vulcan rocket booster due to launch for the first time around 2020, well before the ban on the RD180. Of course Blue Origin is also developing it's own launch system called the New Glenn, which in capabilities will be placed between SpaceXs Flacon 9 and Falcon Heavy.

The main thing about the new space race is the continued development of new technology reducing the price for access to space both for private companies and the government, thus reducing the amount of tax payers money used to send equipment to space."
"SJWs really should read Soul of the Apostolate.

if they don't they can end up like bitter religious sisters brothers and priests, worn out from this or that cause and protest. 

The point the book makes escapes SJWs as they race out to the next protest. 

The ""work of the Church"" is actually the work of Jesus Christ, and for most of us, it's done mainly in and around our home.  It's where all the real action and growth needs to happen."
This is a good point. The guy is a thief; he just targeted the least sympathetic group of individuals as his target so that other sociopaths would see him as some sort of Robin Hood figure.

"I stopped watching CBC 2 years ago around the end of the Harper era. While there might have been funding dispute with the Harper Government, I could no longer stomach the anchor who is retiring, way too biased to the left. Until they start presenting BALANCED information, they are irrelevant. For me, I pass!."

"If you can't abide by Variously Socialized Systems of Government, you must look for a new country that will accept you as a Citizen. Are you a Canadian commenting here? Welcome to Socialized Healthcare! Now, do you have a problem with that? Yes or no, here's a follow up: guy climbs ladder, falls, compound fracture, $120 000 hospital bill... what do you say to that? Fantastical-Free-Market got your answer? No insurance so you're going to let him die? Here's another one (flashback query): What do you think about the Japanese dumping TVs into our market priced at below the cost to make them? What do you think about Japanese housewives in mass protests because it costs more for them to buy a Japanese TV than it cost an American 6000 miles away? What do you think about Antitrust Monopoly busting? What do you think of this Phantasy Phrase Phloating around the Armchair-Economic-Expert set: Phree Market?  It's not free, it never was, it never should be. $15 MINIMUM WAGE IS TOO LOW."
"This may not be strictly religious issue but one of the major underlying problems that results in very negative thinking and behavior such as racism, abortion, and the list goes, is solutions to the change in the economy to a post industrial service economy. If we keep harping on the change without offering suggestions we get reactionary retribution thinking where the blame is everybody and it makes some vulnerable to manipulation.  I would suggest people think about how to create service occupations other than the military. We are going through a profound change in the way people make a living and many are very scrared and angry about it and feel powerless to do anything.  This is a worldwide problem where people pour into cities where they cannot find adequate work so the move somewhere else. I will let the reader finish it. We need ideas that are positive and not the usual how bad things are and blame ......... . Filling in the blank does work."
"By deciding to reject the Paris agreement on climate change, President Trump signals that the US is not serious about combating global warming. A unified stance among these seven countries would show the rest of the world that the future of all our children and their children matters. The science behind the threat of climate change is well established and new data regarding its impact on the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets is a resounding confirmation. Mr. Trump may not see the issue the way everyone else does but taking off those blinders may be the solution."
"In retrospect, I was perhaps a little too dogmatic saying that value investing ""does not work"" in tech and retail.   Perhaps it is fairer to say that I am more inclined to ""pay up"" in these sectors, for something that really is a better mouse trap.  

That said, In retail, a steady pattern of weak same store sales scares the c&@p out of me....sometimes it is best to not try and figure out ""why""...and just wait for another bus."

"Monsignors became an endangered species in Peoria under Myers' predecessor, who made none in his twenty years as bishop, even though he himself mad been a monsignor!  But Myers generously rewarded his buddies, including a couple of them later identified as pedophiles.  Oops!  So, becoming a monsignor in Myers' Peoria was a mixed bag, but still fit the stereotype of ""candy for the children.""  But as the old story goes, we know that God is a UIUC alum because the sun is orange, and the sky in blue!  Meanwhile, I very much enjoy your posts here!  Keep up your good work, please!"
Do we have indigenous approval for this?
Welcome to the third world ...Canada has a smaller middle class all the time.  Rich ....Poor.  As in all third world countries home ownership is possible only by one generation leaving the family home to the next generation and so on. It is too difficult to get a job to make payments on a home for 35 years. Not worth the sacrifice. I am sure many home owners today realize that.

"I would rather bring back the student loan forgiveness program.  If you returned to Alaska within six months of college graduation, you could get up to 50% of your Alaska student loan forgiven. A great incentive for Alaskans who attended college around the country to bring their skills and knowledge back to Alaska"
"I think Mr. Svendsen is confused about the 50% number because many of those working in Alaska do not live in Alaska.  Oil and Gas industry more than 40%, Commercial fishing double the percentage, Mining and of course Tourism.  Let's start hiring Alaskans instead of having the second highest unemployment number in the nation.  A state income tax seems like the prudent choice so we at least collect something back for all of those lost jobs for Alaskans."

"As the priest shortage continues it is becoming more obvious that celibacy has trumped the availability of Mass and the Eucharist to the people of God in the minds of our church leaders.  Unfortunately, given the intransigence of the last 1700 years there will be no hierarchical movement to change this during our lifetimes.  Judging from the past, the future will simply bring more of the same as more and more of the laity feel that their spiritual needs have been minimized by a Church seeking to continue its grasp on sacerdotal control under the guise of the questionable ""holiness"" of celibacy as opposed to the ""holiness"" matrimony.  The unspoken and unbroken barricade is not celibacy, because there are married priests. IT IS CONTROL and the refusal and lack of faith and trust in the Spirit to let go just a little of it."
"Here in BC you can actually schedule two hour shifts. One of my kids had a job for a clothing retailer who used this staffing method.  They also used their employees on an on-call basis, so you never knew your shifts in advance.

And yes, employees would be called in for two hour shifts and sent home.  At minimum wage transportation costs leave almost nothing."

"It's the fact that we are being taxed 42.5% and squeezed like a sponge for every penny we have left from landlords, businesses, education, medical, insurance and government, not to mention high interest lenders sucking us into debt early on, all on similar salaries we had 15 years ago. Money goes up the greed chain and every hard working Canadian has to strive to make ends meet and spend a whole life-time digging themselves out of debt while bay street, high level management and boards make millions on the average Canadian. Simple answer is: stop buying anything you don't need to survive and live yoda style. Years ago we had things more simple, a house phone, cable, a car, insurance, rent etc. and today we have multiple cell phones, multiple TV's, tablets, glorious internet packages, multiple vehicles, fee's for music, fee's for apps, etc. So unless you live like a hermit or have good discipline, your not going to end up saving and will always struggle. Cut back, it's that simple."

"Mr. Barron:  Indeed, it will be nice to see some statistical analysis of any ""possible"" impact of Bascom Village on the safety of the surrounding neighborhoods.  When you're the victim of a crime, it's very easy to ""strike out"" (think boxing, not baseball) against some target.  First, you may fantasize what you ""would have done"", had you caught the perpetrators ""in the act.""  Next, you may blame the act on the easiest target....Obviously, for Mr. Graff that's the residents of Bascom Village whom he didn't want in the ""neighborhood"" to begin with.  

I'm a firm believer in the First Amendment.  That said, I really regret the impact of a letter like Mr. Graff's.  Bascom Village, like any affordable housing development, faced NIMBY issues.  All reports I've read and heard from persons living near such developments have been positive,  from some folks positive, combined with pleasant surprise.  Mr. Graff's is extremely negative and, IMO, extremely unfounded....that's too bad.  Gary"
"The classmate of one of my kids was disowned by his mother when he came out in high school. It was awful, and a stark reminder for my kids, about how strong discrimination  can be, that it can even exist within what is supposed to be one of the strongest bonds - mother and child.

Here in conservative Richmond BC, there were no gay/straight alliances or support groups in school. He had a tough time of it, and it was only though the strong support of his father,  that he got through it.

Although to this day his mother has cut off all ties, so how does a child ever get through that.

Yeah, tough call...but schools should not be ""outing"" kids to their parents."
"I think it is fair to treat legitimate refugees who have medical needs, Canada needs to do at least some small part to help out people who have been displaced for war, political persecution, etc.

What gets me though is that even people who have obviously bogus refugee claims and those who have had their claims denied but are delaying things on appeals or just haven't yet been deported are ALSO provided medical care.  And not just the same medical care as Canadians receive, they actually receive superior coverage to Canadian citizens including such things as vision care, dental care and prescription drug coverage.

Trudeau's Liberals deserve nothing but scorn for favouring fake refugee claimants over real refugees or Canadians citizens when they re-instated this coverage that had previously been removed by the Harper Conservatives."
Are you trying to be ironic?
"A little off topic, but it's time for term limits for our legislators.  No more than a total of 16 years combined Senate and House time - that's 2 terms as a senator and 2 terms as a representative.  Time to retire these career politicians early.  Constitutional amendment anyone? 

Career politicians are the most motivated to skirt the rules.  As their political power increases, the special interests lavish more attention (spelled 'money') on them.  They also learn where the best loopholes are."

"@rollandx I think you are failing to differentiate between dictators and non-theist. Dictators don't like competition in the telling you what to think department, that is why they abolish religion. The dictator wasn't put in power by these evil atheists you speak of, they took power. There have been many dictators in communism, socialism, and capitalism. All of these non-religious societies suffered not because of lack of religion, but because of enforced totalitarianism. Non-theists view religion as cancer of the mind; it keeps growing and extending its self from past generations. Some are able to free themselves of it, but many aren't so lucky."

"I'd like to know where the percentage of people who cried foul on Togiak's actions live. My guess is overwhelmingly road system, who enjoy the benefits of on-call police. In rural Alaska, a large percentage of us don't have that luxury. We have to police ourselves and do what is best for our communities. I get the calls (may they always be few and far between) when I'm sleeping at home with my wife and kids, to respond to an assault or a domestic disturbance. Most commenters on here will never understand what that feels like."
This is a good experiment. If we are hoping to sustain a viable economy over the next century or so there has to be a way to redistribute incomes to ordinary people so our consumer society can continue to prosper. The existing economic model is a recipe for stagnation which shows a long term shift away from sustainable employment and toward wealth concentration in fewer and fewer hands.

"Same theme, different organization. I disagree. The University budget has exploded since 2005. Sixteen campuses of which ten could be closed. Offer more online classes. AEDC  parrots the same story as Rasmuson, GCI, Alaskasfuture, Uof A, nonprofits, Unions, certain Republicans, etc. to cut the budget (not ours), use the permanent fund, and tax the people.  Odd isn't it, that none suggest taxing the oil companies instead of giving away the oil and paying out secret tax credits? I contend that this is because all these groups are getting donations or are financed from oil. Many of the legislature are bought and paid by oil. Some are employees of the oil companies. (Not that this would cause them any bias when voting on oil taxes). That is why the conversation never includes this dirty secret about giving away free oil to multinational corporations. Demand different from your representatives. Google Alaska legislature POM and let them hear it."

"OPEC is bad but the broken oil and gas system in Alaska is the worst. 

In my opinion, based on 30 years in the Alaska oil business. 

6 things can help Alaska's failing oil industry and help save Alaska's future;

1.Set up a one stop oil & gas agency and elect five commissioners. 
2. Move Capital to Anchorage or anyplace most Alaskans can drive to and watch these legislators do what they do.
3. Elect the AG,
4. Make Alaska a self insured oil and gas state using the idle $50 million 470 oil spill fun"" thus doing away with the unreasonable c-plan and outrageous permitting and bond cost.
5. Change the rules so Alaskans can afford to drill and find oil and sell it for a profit.
6. Allow for a jury trial in all oil & gas disputes to stop the Agency kangaroo hearings that do not give due process, making Alaska less fair then some third world oil & gas nations that cheats it's people of the wealth! 

These 6 things may help stop things that do not serve the people and make Alaska great again"

50% of their income to rent an apartment. And most of them spend food money on rent because they have to choose one or the other. I think it's fine that apartment owners want to make money. We all do. But do they have to be so greedy about it? Just because you can doesn't mean you should. People aren't getting a living wage most of the time so cut them a break and lower rent. If you don't, your competition will."
Trump better pay attention to this because this is quickly getting worse.  Puerto Ricans are US citizens too.  His administration was not prepared and did not anticipate the magnitude of this disaster.  Now his administration is in reaction and spin mode.
"After two generations of progressive education starting with Daddy Trudeau in Canada, it appears that most Canadians are indoctrinates of the left and incapable of linear thinking and the ability to apply valid epistemology criteria to determine what is factual and what is opinion.  Now mind you,  all of you are entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts.  Now some facts.   

The Congressional Oversight Committee demanded two days ago that the CIA and other agencies who claim that the Russians cyber-interfered in the Presidential election brief them on the validity and proof of this allegation.  The CIA and the other agencies refused saying the White House told them not to.  The FBI alone stated there is zero evidence of anyone, the Russians, the Chinese, or Joe the Geek in his pajamas cyber- interfering with the Presidential election.  No single incident is offered as proof nor a source named.  One must conclude this is leftist propaganda to legitimize President Elect Trump."
"Really, columnist? It's notPeters who is out of touch. Have you not heard about Sarah Silverman, Amy Schumer, Kathy Griffin, Tina Fey? Extremely funny often raunchy but obviously very moral, kind, and feminist women?  Like jokes by those women, the jokes by Peters (sigh...we still need to explain this in 2017?) are winks; they have levels; they have quotation marks around them. We laugh at their inappropriateness. That's the joke. His schtick is (write this down) an act! He (write this down too) plays a frat boy! It's a kind of sarcasm, a kind of satire.  You may prefer a different tone for the show as far as hosts go, that's fine, but don't knock Peters. Unless you also take time to knock 80% of female and male comedians out there today."

"The attacks in late Aug. by a small group of Rohingya insurgents are understandable given their abuse over several generations by their own government.

The government has the right to respond to these attacks, by pursuing the perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Which they did - the attackers were killed. THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THE COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT OF AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY. And *that* is what the government of Myanmar is doing. They've been persecuting the Rohingya since the 70s and are now using the Aug. 2017 attacks as an excuse to conduct what the UN has classified as ethnic cleansing:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/un-myanmars-treatment-of-rohingya-textbook-example-of-ethnic-cleansing

So I'm sorry, 'DMOnt1', but YOU ARE DEAD WRONG. There are no 'aggressors on both sides' as you stated - the Myanmar army & Buddhist mobs are the aggressors, the Rohingya are their victims, and have been their victims for almost half a century now!"
"1. Perhaps enemies Trump ordered the Ukrainians to intensify the war (which means to start killing civilians as the safest and easiest way).
2. Maybe it's just a war ""American style"" - result of work American instructors (like was in the war 08.08.08).
3. Possible violation of the Minsk agreements (and killing of civilians) is independent initiative of Kiev."

"Not everything has to be political, but 4 years with the RG has given me a better understanding of why conservatives would feel they are running uphill.

The RG seems to be acting with intention to publish more reports on free speech.   We've seen a couple covering campus complaints at various colleges around the nation.   It's not local, they don't have to print it, but they have been.   They've also been publishing more conservative politcal cartoons.    I wouldn't expect a total flip in their editorial slant, but you might look for signs of better balance.     

Liberals are good at feeling guilt, appeals to fairness will work with some, personal insults will work with very few.  I'm not sure why you bite the hand that gives you so much access to be heard?

Trump is hurting with seriously inexperienced people.   I'm sure he's see them as a new path, but so far they just look lost- it should improve."

It is a ruse now, and always has been a ruse.  The Refuge (look up the term ""refuge"" - nothing in there about $$$ for profit)  has never had enough to make the U.S. energy independent, and never will.  It's all darkly laughable now, with a nationwide oil glut, while exporting oil.  Distribution and corporate supply/price manipulation will drive the cost of your gas at the pump.  If you think we've got a glut now, wait until we really start the flow of Canadian oil sands crude to Texas.  
Renewables are gaining ground day by day, and will make fossil fuel energy obsolete by the time your grandchildren enter the job market."
It's why every Chinese person is desperately trying to get their money out...
"The price of energy is determined almost exclusively by supply side factors Richard.  Investment in production capacity has been reduced by a glut of supply that has eroded prices.

Demand is, as The Snoman points out, remarkably price inelastic, and is very closely tied to economic performance. For example, the only time demand fell during the past generation was in 2008-09.

While it is apparent that some individual choices have been affected by price over time, the impact on overall energy demand has been negligible.   

Given this reality, its pretty clear that carbon taxes are much more about taxes than they are about carbon."
No it isn't it's an illegal head tax not allowed by state law the Oregon constitution on. All the exemptions violate state law section 32 of the Oregon constitution on uniform taxation in the territory area. The penalties for non payment violate Oregon state tax law on only being able to charge a 5% penalty per year for non payment. Big deal they have said that for years about the IRS and I still haven't received any bill in my name for non payment after 5 years proving how inept these collectors at the revenue bureau are.
"This isn't just an foreigner issue. It's also a domestic greed issue. The real fix, is a speculation tax for people who own more than one or two properties. A 25% tax Canada wide would flatten out the market and not be challengeable under NAFTA or WTO so long as all Canadians are affected."
"It wasn't an anti-diversity memo. He was basically outlining the differences between men and women. And contrary to the current socialist narrative, men and women ARE different. It's based on biology and science that no SJW can undo simply because it make them feel good.

"Having a Quebec lieutenant would not have helped Trudeau answer the question.

My recollection is that PET was promoting bilingual services across the country, not just in provinces with large numbers of speakers of a particular language.

These same people in real time shot down any youth programmes/initiatives in their parishes, complained about noise, complained about the music the young people  liked. The list is endless.

I agree with everything else you say, just keep in mind that the Church is in the ""already, but not yet"" time window between the resurrection and the end times.

Compare the 1994 catechism with older catechisms, and you may find some surprising discontinuities which, nevertheless, do not compromise perfect continuity with the Sacred Scriptures and Sacred Tradition.  For instance, go looking for the old stuff about women not being ""proper matter"" for the sacrament of Holy Orders.  Can you find it?  What else can you find instead?  Hint: CCC 1566"

"Wonderful article. I had the life changing experience of living in McGrath and learning from natives how to hunt, gather berries and wood, and what it meansto live in a community.

An elder also came to the kill site to gether favorite parts including the tongue, liver, caul fat, kidneys and everything else she was able to use. Hunting is part of rural life that many who have not lived there will not understand.

"Atlantic salmon don't breed in our waters & don't breed with our native species. Suggesting as some have that they are invasive is hyperbole.

The earliest attempts to introduce atlantic salmon as a wild-foraging species date to 1874 in California, then 1904 in Washington State and 1905 in BC when 90,000 fry were released into the Coquitlam River, Lillooet River, and Harrison Lake on the mainland and into Campbell River, Comox Lake, Horne Lake, Nanaimo Lake, Cowichan Lake and Koksilah River on Vancouver Island. In total 200,000 Atlantic salmon eyed-eggs, fry, fingerlings and smolts were introduced into B.C. waters that year.  The bulk of releases were into the Cowichan River system. 

There have been almost continuous attempts to establish Atlantic salmon in the Pacific right up to the 1980s.  Every attempt to introduce Atlantic salmon as wild foraging and self-sustaining have failed for almost 150 years."
""" ...in his latest medium-range nuclear missile test.""

Globe editors should review their style book. The missile was neither powered by nuclear forces nor did it carry a nuclear weapon. This was simply a missile system test, of the sort that country's around the world frequently conduct. Granted, North Korea could try to put nuclear weapons in their missiles in the future. However its not a trivial task and to date there is no evidence that they've succeeded in doing it.

It goes without saying that having nuclear weapons is no deterrent at all if you don't have a reliable means of delivering them to an enemy. North Korea does have crude nuclear weapons. Building reliable long-range missile systems is an even more daunting engineering task. North Korea will continue to conduct missile tests for the foreseeable future."

"Your fallacious reasoning is a perfect example of begging the question,Erv. Is the pension system underfunded according to the law? We don't know. Is the law clear on the issue? We don't know.

You presuppose, with zero understanding of the facts, law, or issues, that the answers to some or all of these questions is no. 

Please help me understand, Erv, how something other than deep-seated animus toward all things Adventist could induce one to build a moral case on a foundation devoid of factual or legal knowledge or understanding.

Tarek Fatah is seen as a right-wing extremist. Even if Muslims and ex-Muslims wish to speak out it seems they are silenced in the ever-widening circle of don't ask...don't tell...atmosphere surrounding extremism.  Khan would better serve her religion if she were to unequivocally condemn such acts, with no ifs, ands, or buts.  I think people like Khan are part of the problem, her M103 at the centre of it.

"Cayabird, I think you only care about this rape because it was committed by an illegal. Which is a shame. Most rapes are committed by people born in the US. Are you 30? Then  you know women who have been raped; maybe a man too. I know a number of women who have been raped. And a man. None of them were raped by an illegal.

It's a very common crime. There's someone being raped as you read this.

There is no ""bias by omission."" The rape you mention of a young woman in Maryland isn't ""notable"" enough to make most national news stories. There are hundreds, thousands of women (and men) raped each day in the US. The nat. news only picks up on those that have something that would take the story beyond the local level (a famous person involved, particularly gruesome, etc). If the news covered every violent crime in the US, there'd  be no room left for other news."

This also impacts the supply of homes available because these homes are unavailable while they are being rebuilt over perhaps a year's time. Of course, these homes come back on the market eventually, but, in the meantime, other homes are purchased by re-builders so that there is always an ongoing reduced inventory.

"I read your 1960's study in more detail.   As no surprise, at age 9, the control group and preschool group had the exact same IQ level of 87.    What you also FAILED to mention is this was not just preschool for needy kids.   This was part time preschool augmented by family intervention and the participants were often single parent African American households.    The cost savings cited in the study were questionable and underlying factors had not been considered in totality.   Here's a link of an assessment done in 2011.

"No, just natural realities.

We get sick, we have headaches and sores, we get terminal illness.

The question is:  Have you learned how to sanctify all the realities that God allows in your life?

Here's one:  People make silly or cutting or sarcastic remarks for various reasons and deficiencies.   

Well formed Catholics say: It's our own defects that make us unhappy. I refuse to let this person's small or cutting or cynical or snide remarks dampen my cheer at all.  I am an adopted and loved child of God. Nothing can shake my joy.  God is my Father after all.

And so rather than getting sad or upset when someone makes a small or sarcastic or cutting remark, the well formed Catholic simply integrates this experience with the suffering that Jesus happily took on for us.  

We unite our suffering with us, and we are joyful because of this intimacy we share with Joy Himself."

"Open Letter to Daily Maverick editors, and a challenge to highlight it where you highlight your anti Trump gumpf every morning.
Dear DM Editors, Please get over this Russia thing, it has taken CNN from number one watched news channel in the US to, as some say, behind Yogi Bear reruns in popularity. They, the Clinton's, the Democratic Party and CNN, have been trying to prove collusion between Trump and the Russians that got him elected. What got him elected was Hilary, she lost, nothing else. 
Do you think the US is not trying to interfere in the domestic policy of just about every country they think matters? Russia does the same, China does the same, a piddling $250,000 ad campaign on Twitter is not going to change the way the people think.
Dem. Sen. Mark Warner says it is ""Deeply disappointing and inadequate"", yes it is, because they didn't find anything to incriminate Trump.
So please DM stick to uncovering local corruption and stop repeating CNN BS.
Thanks."

Yet we have more houses now....We are building almost 200 k new houses every year...Our population growth including the immigration is merely one percent. If you exclude the immigration, we dont have any growth at all....Yet we pretend that we dont have any house here. Our realtors like to sell 600 square feet condo for 500k as if we dont have any land in canada.....NO SUPPLY PROBLEM....only speculation....All the vancouver speculators jumped to gta after bc enacted foreign speculators tax.

"I actually flew Anchorage to Spokane recently after finding the lower fare on Delta, and I elected to upgrade to first class.That trip was far and above MUCH better than if I flew on Alaska Air, which I have done to the same destination previously. Delta seats in Economy and First Class are far more comfortable than Alaska. The Delta regional jet from Seattle to Spokane actually had a comfortable first class section, unlike Alaska where your a sardine and you get to know your neighbor more than you want to. My status with Alaska went down from 75K to MVP and so did my mileage plan miles, but I don't care; I'm tired of Alaska's marginal service overall."

"The opening paragraph of this letter is interesting. The letter writer opens by making a claim to special status due to age and state residency then makes an obviously false claim that ""there is no difference among people of different races, genders and religions,""--the very statement is a contradiction. I would hope Mr. Granas was trying to say that despite differences among people everyone should be equal before the law. But that's not what he said. Worse yet, he makes the ridiculous claim that every person could choose to be themselves (untrue, ask any gay person over the age of 65) and then implies that someone has ""shoved something in his face"" although he doesn't say who or what. ""We all got along fine"" he claims which I translate as we all got along fine so long as minorities stayed in their place. Your tranquility is going to be disturbed Mr. Granas because the youth aren't going to stay in their racially designated places any longer."

"Status-quo is good for Canada, so it's so much the better if Trump doesn't follow through.

However, I believe that Trump can score an easy win if he cancels NAFTA but keeps/reactivates the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement.  Or tries to, if it turns out he doesn't have that authority as President (which most US commentators, at least at the moment, seem to suggest he has).

Who in the US will go to bat, politically, for free trade with Mexico?  Talk about a walking piñata!  Haha.

I think it's unlikely the Canadian government would withdraw from free trade in a pique over the US cancelling free trade with Mexico - nor would it be in Canada's interest despite some good reporting by the Globe and Mail on the disadvantages of FTA vs. NAFTA."
"Thanks, Mr. Havelock, for pointing out that Alaskans own our state's resource wealth and the Permanent Fund in common. It's a problem that many residents are unaware of Alaska's history, unique Owner State model and shareholder rights. Now, the Legislature and Governor are railroading Alaskans toward a specific fix for the budget problem - all their plans involve changing the Fund and PFD without public consent. We must not allow this THEFT of the Peoples' money. Take the PFD OFF the table. NO POMV without a public vote. Then, the legislators will be more motivated to consider the many options for a solutions (like government reform, taxes, selling and leasing assets, using Fund earnings by public consent) and survey Alaskans for what we services we want and how we want to pay for them.  Visit and share this website for the Permanent Fund Defenders and join the fight to protect the PFD.  www.pfdak.com STOP THE RAID"

The boom is not going to continue much longer. The market is nearing saturation for apartments and high end houses. Population growth is going to start slowing due to skyrocketing costs of housing and decreasing quality of life thanks to growth. Landlords are already seeing tenants leaving Colorado. Buildings in areas like Cap Hill that were full two years ago now have regular vacancies. 

Classic Colorado foolishness - project future demand based on a temporary boom. There are some big problems looming - starting with WATER! Once again the Front Range is in drought conditions. And we are shattering heat records weekly. Next big problem - a transportation infrastructure that is already nearing gridlock. I-25 has returned to being a parking lot most of the time.

The biggest variance is for Cuba. Here it shows 527,757 Canadian visitors but according to The Conference Board of Canada, this number is 1,299,980, a difference of 772,223 while Statistics Canada show the figure as 800,000.
Variations appear for the other countries too but this is the most glaring.
Does the number depend on who is gathering the data and which one is accurate?

"Honest:
Oh wouldn't it be nice if we could reduce the complexities of life to a 30 second sound bite.
It turns out to be more complex than you believe. Eating carbs and snacking frequently results in some physiologic processes that complicate things. In its simplest form (and this is just just touching the complexity) too many carbs raises insulin, promoting calorie storage and most importantly blocks hormone sensitive lipase. This last step prevents the body from utilizing fat stores. 
So our current recommended dietary pattern encourages fat deposition, and prevents it from being reduced.  Not simply calories in calories out. The laws of thermodynamics hold true, but in the context of our hormonal milieu.
Ketogenic diet and fasting fixes the hormonal problem."

Staff Sergeant Kurt Curtiss, 27, of Murray, Utah, died Aug. 26 in Paktika Province, Afghanistan, of wounds suffered when he was shot while his unit was supporting Afghan security forces. Staff Sergeant Michael Murphrey, 25, of Snyder, Texas, died Sept. 6 in Paktika province after being wounded by an IED. Like Bergdahl, Bowen, Walker, Curtiss and Andrews, Murphrey was part of the 4th BCT from JBER. 2nd Lieutenant Darryn Andrews, 34, of Dallas, Texas, died Sept. 4 in Paktika Province when enemy forces attacked his vehicle with an improvised explosive device and a rocket-propelled grenade.Private 1st Class Matthew Martinek, 20, of DeKalb, Ill., was seriously wounded in Paktika province; he died six days later."

There are certain things that can be 'decolonised' and some things that can't.

This article is a clear warning to those wishing to see the baby going with the bathwater.

I do feel that there is a certain hypocrisy however that pervades the 'radical' Decoloniser's objectives, diluting what is a valid argument (from any POV), into a cloudy soup of selective compromise. 

Revolutionaries (and I refer back to the FMF protests) IMO are only 'true' if they deal in absolutes. Selectivity is not a luxury that the vociferous are licensed to possess. Removal of selective coloniser's knowledge should also include the removal of any cultural appropriation a Decoloniser has adopted too. After all, culture IS knowledge-based!

We should perhaps add a comparable tax to marijuana and drive-through food and drink, which brings all those down by a 40% so we're looking at
less than a quarter per gallon of fuel and per alcoholic drink and just over a dime per non-alcoholic drink.

None of those are going to get standing ovations (what tax does?). Can we at least admit that much of the consumption shown is luxury in nature?

"When NAFTA was implemented, not only was it destructive to the U.S. working middle class, it also decimated the Mexican family farm. Millions of farming livlihoods were destroyed, overswept by a neofeudalist wave of 'free' trade. The jobless went north.

Mexico is seen as a slave labor colony to be exploited by the global elite. The peoples of Mexico are oppressed by a ruthlessly corrupt narco-government which serves as suzerain for  U.S. based industrialists, who in return grant limited autonomy and protection to certain compliant drug racketeers who subjugate public and labor.

It's unrealistic to believe in an incorruptable government, because the temptations of power and lucre have always overwhelmed corrupt people to abuse their control throughout the ages. Nowadays, their ill intent for others is magnified by cutting edge technologies which allow bad people to do great harm with insane efficiency. 

The global elite live by their own rules. They have abrogated the social compact."
"It is not a question of whether the county can tax enough to give employees what they want.  Of course they can.  The question is what is reasonable pay.  This cannot be answered by referencing pay to other counties as all counties face zero competition or need to be frugal.  Pay should be determined by a combination of comparison with similar private for profit company compensation (real competition sets wages scale) and direct experience of how much pay is necessary to hire new employees able with reasonable training to do the jobs.

It is widely believed that county pay exceeds reasonable expectation for work performed.  If this is indeed the case.  We must not shy away from accepting a strike and waiting until county employees either accept reasonable wages or quit so that new and better employees can be hired.

This one Lane county voter suggests that the county lock the doors for at least one month once the unions strike.  Think of the possible park improvements enabled."

"Despite what Metrolinx states, this area really needs a GO Train station for high capacity fast transit downtown, as well as to provide GTHA wide mobility. Many area residents work in Mississauga and Oakville and must drive to work for lack of transit options. 

The planned Waterfront LRT to this neighbourhood it will be much better than the 501 Queen streetcar that goes through the area. 

Until transit is vastly improved here, most residents will continue to drive, causing huge congestion at peak hours as well as greatly adding pollution to the lakeside natural habitat. 

Metrolinx is being shortsighted, if they can approve a GO station for a minister in an empty field in Kirby, they can build a useful GO station in a high density neighbourhood to alleviate congestion. With the Regional Express Rail electrification coming to the Lakeshore West GO line, this additional stop won't be much of a time delay, perhaps a minute or two for local trains."
I agree with previous comments that to take this sum of money is impossible. Even if I get this money it won’t be enough to renovate kitchen or other parts or apartment. I have renovated my apartment and hire worker for doing that http://servicewhale.com/ . It saves my time for working and paying for repair. But even if I did it by myself it could cost more than $1000.

Do we really need a new jail??? What are we doing for the inmates we have to insure that when they are released they will not return. Are we educating them?? Training them for a job? Giving them the mental health and social services they need?  Helping them kick their addictions?  Treating them as human beings who can rejoin society? Feeding them food that will nourish their bodies and their minds instead of just filling their stomachs? There are countries in the world that have managed to NOT have a prison population through proper rehabilitation and support instead of just locking up everyone who is homeless or mentally ill or who steals bc he cannot find a job and wants to feed his family. These are social issues that must be addressed first. So let's give them the help they need instead of locking them up and forever stigmatizing them as a criminal. Look to see how other countries have accomplished this--then let's talk about the need for another jail.

"The modern republican party has been appealing to its racist base for more than a generation.  I know it once was the party of Lincoln. But Ronnie Reagan signaled his intentions toward minorities when he opened his campaign in a town that was infamous because a black man had been recently lynched there. Bush Sr. defeated Dukakis by appealing to racial fears with the Willie Horton ads.  And Bush Jr. ( aka the disaster) totally ignored a minority community after it was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.    White people are very fond of calling minorities racists.  And it's true that some minorities are racists. But white racism is institutionalized and affects lives. I'd like to have an alternative to the democratic party.  However, republicans have more than demonstrated that any minority who votes for a republican needs to have their head examined!"

Brown as the highest ranking public official of the Democratic party in Oregon, will feel a responsibility to support funding for all candidates and raising money for all candidates.   
It's why Democrats would alternately run toward the President, then away from him depending on his popularity.   

I've only met Brown once and that was at a forum on election reform.   She seemed open to reform, was serious about how money is allotted by the state to the PRIVATE political parties.   She was at least present at this meeting for reformers of the political election process.   That's more than I an say for most Democrats, who are highly resistent to any changes in the primary that might open the door for non Democrats."

That is a shameful comment to make, Ward 1. You will notice these allegations stem from 1991. It is a civil suit, which anyone can bring against anyone else at any time. Although it claims multiple felonies were committed, there is no, repeat NO criminal case, which means there are no facts in evidence that any prosecutor would touch. If Hillary is elected this suit will be dropped immediately to avoid a counter suit. Notice also that the person providing corroboration would be admitting to felonies of her own, but, surprise, the statute of limitations is likely expired. Why isn't she being sued? She likely has no money to be sued for, and of course, is not running for President. This is a political lawsuit only, intended to even the score for all the horrible things Bill Clinton has done to women. It was brought in June, gained no traction, so then they dug out the 2005 tape. Nonsense."

Then you introduce the word ""predator"".  And again, you can argue that maybe EPD shouldn't be handing out candy because that's what some predators do before they do bad things to kids, and we don't want to condition our kids. But to say that EPD is intimidating, harassing, and preying upon the community because they are handing out candy?? Those are some pretty serious accusations.

If we don`t fight for ourselves with and through a good Governor like Walker, how will we ever stand against graft and conflict in government like that that pervades the majorities on the second floor in our capital?   I`d rather we go down fighting rather than just, in fear that they leave us, let them have our oil and gas for nothing in production taxes... let alone these subsidies the Conoco caucus sold us...  just like they sold us the Taj...."
"Thanks for the clueless observation.  And I say clueless because it utterly ignores reality.

White kids do more drugs and represent a much larger segment of the population but they don't get arrested for drugs, and if they do, they're far more likely to have representation, beat the charges (often based on illegal search or lack of probable cause), or simply enjoy a lenient District Attorney.

They don't get pulled over at nearly the same rate.  Would you like an example?  This fifty year old black man was detained, searched and shot to death based on incredibly ""serious crime"" of not having a tail light on his bicycle.

"I'm going to reiterate some of what Jkeb has said. First, a lot of jobs don't come with insurance. And when Obama and others were debating what the ACA might look like, one of their central concerns was the uniquely American tradition of relying on employers to provide insurance. One concern: that it makes American companies less competitive. And if you want to cite personal experience, I have known people who were not able to take new jobs because of pre-existing conditions (because the insurance provider would not cover them). There are good reasons why the pre-existing condition proviso is one of the most popular aspects of the ACA. Finally, with changes the ACA is sustainable. It works very well in some parts of the country. And who else would  carry the cost for anyone ill, with a pre-existing condition or not? Other people with insurance. Because that's what insurance is for - the spread risk around and minimize the cost for all. What would you do? Let them die?"
"The public perception of what lawyers do is overshadowed by adversarial litigation.  Most lawyers spend their time negotiating mountains of paper, regulations, complex problems and interpersonal conflicts.  They are expected to deliver elegant solutions to an incredibly complicated set of problems.  Time and financial strain is crushing.  Plus demanding clients, antagonistic lawyers, unsympathetic public servants,  Judges ... with extremely high standards to do everything right and paper it to exacting standards.  It can be soul crushing."

Therefore all Alaskans should have a voice, which includes fair representation of course, on the Board of Game."

"It's a tangent, but I really think the ""bequest boom"" might be over-stated.

In general, baby boomers are probably going to live longer than their forebears. And this is great news! But health care and general elder care are INCREDIBLY expensive and will probably only become more expensive over time. That is going to eat up a lot of this potential wealth transfer.

I also think that a huge portion of that wealth to be bequeathed, at least in Canada, is related to real estate. I'm not sure how much of it will remain as the social costs from housing unaffordability mount and governments are forced to address the inequities created by their policies in this area.

Though the future will surely continue to bring forth other ways to improve our lives, people might simply have less wealth that needs managing. Maybe financial firms will simply be less relevant long-term."

My vote is an embodiment of my mortality, and is sacred. Corporations with the  ""right"" to participate in funding of election campaigns, etc., directly diminishes my right to free speech and the vote. Corporations inherently function through human citizens, who already have a vote. With ""Citizens United"" my vote is diminished, because other voters now use the corporation to use public assets, goods and services, to harness an economic engine, to in turn, influence elections with false information, alternative facts, etc., diminishing my right. My vote is also diminished because corporations do not become physically ill, and do not die, and do not suffer jail or torture, or have feelings, or experience conscious reality.

These words coming from a head coach, one who has never had one winning season, never been to one playoff game as head coach, even though the bar in the NBA is set so low when it comes to low seeds making the playoffs. 
Go ahead Mr. Malone, throw the players under the bus, the last loser who was head coach just before you did that, it worked real well. 
Sadly, Denver fired a winning coach, one who the year he was fired, took a young inexperienced team to the playoffs, receiving ""Coach of the Year"". He took Denver to the playoffs consistently, year in, year out. He was replaced with two losers, ones who never achieved anything in the NBA as a head coach, ones who the owner said he wanted to take the team ""deeper into the playoffs""."

The political leaders in Seattle are attempting to decide who is ""wealthy"". If this passes (and you should pray it doesn't), don't be surprised when sooner or later liberal cities like Denver decide $50k a year ""a lot of money"" compared to low wage workers and they come after your paycheck or they decide that anyone with $250k in total assets (home + 401k/IRA + investments) is ""wealthy"" and is subject to the new tax."

My children weren't black or native American minorities or financially disadvantaged because both I and my wife worked, so maybe all the scholarship money went to affirmative action.   The non-minority middle class are the payers, not the recipients of governmental largesse, even that doled out by Duck U.

View the results from the perspective of the founders which gave weight to Little States Votes Matter and Trump won 31 of the 50 states.

So lets cut the crap about Trump losing the election.  He won by the rules in force since 1776 or thereabouts.   And he won the over whelming majority of the states.   Period."
"This is over twenty years ago, in comparison to what you say & what I observed during my meetings with him. ""Claustrophobic"" rings a bell. I disagree with labeling him ""bonkers"". My first impression was that he was extremely withdrawn & depressed into despair. It took 2 or 3 attempts over a period of about a week,  to communicate with him before eliciting the reasons for his psychological despair. So, I took a look at his file. The State had 4 witnesses claiming to be the first on the scene describing two people in various stages of fighting outside of a bar. I read his pre-trial statement to his lawyer dated and stamped. At that point, I didn't believe him. I read further in the transcripts to the 13th witness, who knew neither person, was leaving the bar at closing time, didn't know if he was first or last on the scene, but he saw a third person with something shiny in his hand running away from the scene with someone holding Pitt from behind. What matters is, is Pitt innocent? Yes."

There's basically only one option for UH to get into NCAA post season and that is to win the conference.

Take all that money you are spending imprisoning addicts, giving them records, thus reducing their chances of future employment and just driving them right back to drugs -and build the kind of rehab centers wealthy millionaire addicts go to  - and make those free to use, and voluntary.

"I have never met Mayor Blake but  the work she has done for this community deserves recognition not only by  towns folks but nationally. The Mac became a tinder point  figuratively for the entire Canadian economy as well, sadly, as literally.  The task of mayor of any city in Canada small or large is difficult because the cities are legal creatures of provincial governments rather than self-determining and  often find themselves hostage  to political interests elsewhere. An OC wouldn't go amiss.  Or if we don't want to give it to the  women who led the effort, follow the example of the Late King  in the last war when he awarded the George Cross  to the entire Island of Malta"
"This article ends by noting two bills, Dunleavy's SB 89 that affects sex education in public schools and Kelly's SB 174 allowing concealed guns on campus.  These bills display legislative dithering when we least need it, as well as good examples of legislation beyond the bounds of  common sense.  Enough of this nonsense.  Focus, get back to work, and at least try to make rational decisions to hoist ourselves out of our fiscal mess.  Legislators, please show us something other than perpetual circus acts, if you can."

"A lot of these young people were just dumped in the U.S. because so-called immigration advocates were telling the alien parents that the U.S. would never deport them. Why should we protect them.

"This support by the uneducated is a problem.
Lets look at reality, THEN see if you still support Dreamers.
DACA is a DEFERMENT, not an amnesty. No path to Citizenship here. DAPA was killed, but it gave DACA recipients FAMILIES greencards. As many as 3 Million MORE immigrants that get ahead of the line..
Now, ANY Dream Act will give dreamers a path to citizenship, which by present immigration law confers them the ability to sponsor up to 56 Family Members to get CITIZENSHIP after a period on holding greencards. We won't see 50 as an average per dreamer, but 10-12 is a possibility. Then those family members can sponsor up to 56 and and so on. It's called Chain Migration, and takes no added lines to implement. So when those in Congress try to blow smoke by saying the dream act doesn't say this, it doesn't, as the law is already there and you can bet it WON'T be changed.
So how do you like a dream act, NOW?"
"Canada could reduce corporate tax to zero and it would make squat difference.  The non-tax burden in this country is punitive.  EI, pension plans , maternity leave, extended health, Workers comp etc, not to mention lower per hour worker productivity, immense regulatory burden and higher wages  means that we are competitive in the US market if, and only if our Loonie stays low.   Poloz and crew know this and cannot raise rates in case the loonie strengthens thereby crushing GDP growth.

The irony of course is that the BOC low interest rate policy is a primary driver in Canada's over heated housing market.   So the downtrodden but well paid masses have a cheque to cash but no home to live n.

Why should a doctor make more than a postal clerk anyway? It's not fair.

We should all have government jobs - the kind where we don't have to really work to get good wages, superior benefits and a great pension.

So let's crush the ""rich"" professional class and the private sector. We'll use their money to create jobs - good government bureaucrat jobs.

And when the cost of the bloated public sector and debt cause the economy to collapse, and  the private sector can no longer create jobs and pay taxes, and we can't find a family doctor, etc.

"Garrison, you are quite ignorance so I'll excuse your silly comments. During my years working in the housing units of CIPT, nearly all the native inmates I got to know and there are quite a few of them, nearly all, committed their crimes while under the influence of drug or alcohol or both. Your racist ignorance ignored the deep problem within the native people regarding both issues. Its a issue that often been ignored by native leadership and by people like you.  But issue is real and every native inmates I met, most would say that they would have never done what they had done, if they were sober. You know what? I actually believe many of them! But their crimes were far too serious to excuse them. That is the real tragedy which you are utterly ignorant of."

How many more families will mourn the unjust loss of a loved one while their murderer(s) go free? How many times will the courts allow the police - some of whom manifestly lack the judgement and/or training to make good decisions, including whether they are truly in danger - to kill innocent citizens because of their unfounded fears?  The ""I felt in fear for my life"" standard needs to go, and go now. Hold these officers accountable and most importantly, hold their fellow officers and superiors accountable.  Police officers need to be strictly vetted and trained extensively before being handed a weapon and the authority to use deadly force.  The ones who cannot control themselves cast a shadow over those officers who can and who do an extremely difficult job well."

Trump does represent change with many unknowns and uncertainty, as opposed to Clinton who stood for keeping the status-quo corporate power structure in place, with it's widening insulation from the working middle-class that has been under siege for years.

I liked the positive upbeat tone, especially coming from a woman, because most of the women I've talked to feel persecuted from what they mistakenly view as the ""white male backlash"", when the problem is that the Democratic party had abandoned the working class, and instead focused on gender and racial politics.

"Justice for the financial industry - Don't hold your breath.

Since 2008, when the criminal activities of the financial sector brought the world economy down with it's fraudulent mortgage securities, then AG Eric Holder, who's last job was at a law firm that represents banks, failed to prosecute any of those responsible. Instead, small fines have been levied on the banks, which has become the practice.

HSBS fined for laundering drug money
Banks fined for LIBOR fixing fraud
Wells Fargo fined for predatory lending in 20012

The list is too long. Madoff and his ponsi scheme existed for years after it was revealed to the SEC. Government regulators, when they're not working for the banking industry, turn a blind eye to fraud justifying wrist slap fines because banks are too big to fail. Small fines for banks can then be paid with 0% loans from the FED. 

Remember, politicians are paid to tell us they are looking out for the people, when they are only protecting their benefactors, not us"

"Very poorly written article.

A few paragraphs later we are then told that ""Bevin"" provided more information.

"'Voodoo' sells donuts, it's not a buzzword. I never said opening storefronts in the square translates directly into thousands of jobs.

If a year round covered Farmer's Market were built, there would be more room for new vendors to join the market. Currently there is not enough room. More sales space for more farms will directly provide more employment.

I then zoom out further to the 2021 corrupt track and field events, and make the point that even more people will travel and move here in years ahead. The sustainable food economy includes farms, restaurants, caterers, wholesalers and distributors, value added processing, retail... Not only will a resurgence in local agriculture provide job growth for these employment niches, but increased activity in this sector will ripple outward into banking, hardware, services etc."

Oil revenues to our State, are likely going down further, with the world situation, and oil companies running our Senate.
The House has a multi-pronged approach that balances the budget without draining our savings.  The Senate refuses one of the prongs (income tax) so they need to specify a replacement. Or step aside and let the adults lead.
We KNOW a sales tax hurts families the most, income tax the least.  But I'd rather have a sales tax than drain the CBR. Explain why all those nonres slopers are allowed to skate.  Can a sales tax could raise enough without taking food out of kid's mouths?
If you must put being reelected over doing the right thing, at least support a sales tax."

It's nice to see more fans turn out to support the Woofs . Even though at times the crowd looked more like a scene out of the 1970's TV show Romper Room or a day care center run amok . If the Seawoof players showed even half the passion those thousands of kids in the stands showed , UAA could have made half a game of it.

"Gerrymandering isn't the only thing that has unbalanced the system. The Republicans' complete abandonment of longstanding political decorum in exchange for short-term political gain has as well. As Charles Blow writes in today's NY Times, ""Democrats have grown too soft. They are still trying to fight a gentleman’s war in the middle of a guerrilla war. Their efforts to reach across the aisle keep being met by hands wielding machetes; their overwhelming impulse to take the high road ignores the fact that Republicans have already blown up the bridge on the high road."" Playing by Marquess of Queensbury rules when your opponent is wielding machetes will get Democrats nowhere but killed. In today's toxic political environment hardball is the only game in town. You either play it or you lose. Everyone gets their hands dirty but one side wins. That careful, measured approach you so admire has gone out the window. It is now just a quaint relic of the past and it's not coming back."

 If the cooled liquid is released in a spill during transport it will warm. As LNG warms the liquid begins to vaporize. 

The gas produced by this warming is typically methane.

If a spill occurs and the vapor does not ignite, it would build to higher concentrations. 

At higher concentrations, vaporized methane will cause an asphyxiation hazard to anyone exposed. 

If a spill or leak followed by a vaporization event were to occur in or near water, then water in contact with the spilled LNG can accelerate the vaporization process and increase the concentration of vapor in the immediate area.

Also, if water is involved, a BLEVE andor an RPT is possible, those are industry euphemisms for explosions.

Of course, in a train wreck, think metal on metal, sparks are likely.  Ignition sources will lead to an explosion and likely fire, which will lead back to the source.

And liquid methane can cause cryogenic burns.

"As the article focuses on what Conservatives shouldn't do and fails to indicate what they can do in any detail, it's clear that for them there is no winning approach.  Mr Trudeau cannot be beaten, he reflects perfectly the Canadians of today, and the ever-popular PM and the Liberals are fully aware of it. And life has never been better for his base - the public sector, the unionized teachers & professors (who inculcate the young to be anti-Conservative, anti-capitalist) and the other groups of the government paycheque-receiving aristocracy of Canada.  And even many of the private-sector workers who pay for this aristocracy choose not to vote Conservative so, all in all, we all deserve each other."

"For someone who works at UAF, it seems to me that the focus has always been Anchorage First. UAF has a renowned engineering department so the legislature provides funds to build an engineering building - at UAA. We get a shell. We have internationally acclaimed scientists at UAF and so UAA is allowed to create science programs that confer Masters and doctoral degrees, both of which were and are already available at UAF. Sixty-five percent of Alaskans live in southcentral and so most of the legislators are from southcentral. The legislature is largely to blame for the excessive money spent on duplication at UA. The idea behind Strategic Pathways, if I understand it correctly, is that each of the three MAUs will have a focus yet all will continue to offer the courses that are required as general education requirements.

They love to be where the action is; where they can get free water and electricity for the TVs and air conditioners with which they furnish their tents.  Where they can get shopping carts, collect cans for the deposit, and have plenty of people passing by whom they can harass for handouts.

In other words, rather than one person being financially ruined by ill health - the point of insurance - the cost is spread among everyone.  Break this down into smaller groups and the risk of catastrophic costs hitting someone in that group rises; when that happens that groups premiums skyrocket.  More, put ""healthy"" people in one group and ""unhealthy"" people in another group, and it is a foregone conclusion which group will have higher expenses.

"Funny, funny and hilarious. Konrad forgot to write about 2042's elderly PM, Justin Trudeau who was hobbling around in a walker. Back in 2017, The elderly twice divorced PM had admired his close family friend 'el commandante' Castro of Cuba so much and respected brutal military dictatorships like Cuba and China that he declared himself Canada's leader for life. Canadians,  being too timid and terrified to stand up for themselves for fear of offending the progressives and globalists accepted it. Canadians couldn't care less as they were too busy being forced to pay ever increasing huge mortgages. You see in 2017, El Comandante Trudeau , had such love for the brutal military dictatorship of China that he allowed unlimited free trade and unlimited residency to the wealthy of China. Canadians were forced to compete for shelter with the 50 million wealthy who eventually took advantage of it. The elderly PM lived full time in the Bahamas in the same mansion he bought in 2017 on his vacations"

"Who he appoints as cardinals is, by far, the most important aspect of Francis' legacy. It took the Church centuries to shake the strangle-hold Italy had on the papacy, and it was largely the increased number of cardinals from the western hemisphere that allowed that to happen. Now we are taking it to the next level and expanding the college to include more electors from the developing world. I doubt we'll ever see a Euro-centric papacy again.

These new additions are a mixed bag in terms of the usual ""conservative/liberal"" metric, but they seem to be of common mind on the issue of solidarity with the poor and marginalized. What Catholicism will look like in 100 years is anybody's guess, but my sense is that we are moving toward that ""poor Church for the poor"" which Francis wants. Bring it on."
"Here is the problem with your position. If you insist on ignoring the 'will' of a substantial portion of the population of a region, then you often end up in civil war. The US is perhaps the most famous example of that. Lincoln had absolutely zero business insisting that the 'union' remain in tact. In fact, the war of independence had been fought on exactly that principle - the enduring 'right' of people to choose their own path, if that is the only way they can find the freedom they seek."

"It appears that as Canada progresses into a more mature stage of nationality and maturity it is incumbent upon its citizens, as a whole to reflect upon what makes one a Canadian citizen.  What can each of us do to make our home and country one in which all of us individually believe and  behave in the common good. In this instance, to what degree is the wearer of the burqa prepared to contribute to the tradition of uncovered faces and facial recognition.

"To quote the article, ""The central bank and governor Stephen Poloz are in wait-and-see mode"".  

Well, nothing has changed in the shaded and jaded offices at the BOC.   For the sake of our country, couldn't we ask Poloz to step aside and bring in new blood from outside the BOC that has fresh ideas to lift Canada out of the economic gutter?     We need a governor with a backbone to step forward and advise the current government that gross over spending and astronomical deficits are not helping one iota.    All we have is continuous and relentless erosion of our economy here.     As we sink, Liberals are taxing more with bogus cap and trade scams, making the downward spiral gain speed and momentum.     Perhaps a BOC governor could bring these failings forward before it's too late."

"Yes... and?

That is why in my post I wrote ""as such they have protection at international law that we have enshrined in our domestic legislation.""  That domestic legislation is enforceable.

As far as reform, the legislation and processes we now have are in place because in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada determined that the lack of an oral hearing for a refugee claimant before an independent tribunal was unconstitutional.  

See Singh v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177

Singh determined that any person in Canada even without legal status was protected by the Charter.  That decision was based on section 7 rights to security of person and fundamental justice. The SCOC ruled the government's claim that giving hearing to refugees would be burdensome was too utilitarian a concern, and that administrative convenience would rarely be sufficiently compelling to justify infringing a Charter right.

So good luck getting changes past the courts."

Thanks for the sincere comment. The essence of democracy and free society is the debate.

"This nonsense of ""playing chicken"" is what's unsafe to begin with, and the recent teat-for-tat* activity has the potential to threaten world peace.

The particular incident shown here occurred on 6/19.  Only two days later in an obvious retaliation, we ""buzzed"" a transport plane carrying Russian defense minister Sergei K. Shoigu (again, over the Baltic Sea).  Our fighter was itself intercepted and chased off by a Russian fighter and there were no US complaints that its actions were anything but professional.

We're claiming, disingenuously, that we had no knowledge Shoigu was aboard.  Don't make me laugh.

The Baltic is not a NATO lake and a transport plane can easily be differentiated from a bomber.  These gratuitous interceptions and harassments on both sides must stop.  They can only exacerbate international tensions that are already high, and they could easily serve as triggers for far more dangerous escalations.

"Inner city schools have plenty of money?????  In what universe?
The suburban public schools that have good funding do very well by their students.  Inner city schools, with many poor children do not have nearly enough money to provide the services necessary.

In the US, no strong, likable female leader has emerged. When one does, no doubt she will elected. There have been 6 leaders of muslim nations, Megawati of Indonesia, Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Khaleda Zia, of Bangladesh, Tansu Çiller of Turkey, Hasina Wajed of Bangladesh and Mame Madior Boye of Senegal, all relatively recent.

"It would appear that the religion of Islam covers a wide spectrum of beliefs with different interpretations. Some of the sects within it are very peacefully while others, like ISIL, are not. It also appears that the various sects each feel that the others have misinterpreted the true meaning of the faith. This really an issue for Muslims to resolve however,  if it is to fit into the 21st century the religion of Islam is badly in need of a major overhaul. 
In the interim perhaps we could make a dent in this kind of thing if we dealt with the mosques and educational institutions which preach a very conservative version of Islam, (salafism/Wahhabism/Muslim Brotherhood organizations for example) as these are the groups that are preaching a more conservative, one prone to a more violent interpretation"

"It was by UN resolution that Israel was created. That was rejected by the Arab World and the rest is history. I point this out because those opposed to Israel often point to UN resolutions to protest current Israeli actions, but fail to note the UN resolution that created Israel.
So the blame game is unhelpful; its too bad a pragmatic solution to the Israel/Palestine conflict was not worked out 30 years ago; back then, that might have stemmed some of the current upheaval. But the problems of the MidEast have morphed into something new and I am not certain that a just peace between Israel and Palestine would solve current West/Islam and Shiite/Sunni antagonisms. But, it would be a good start. It is true that the boundaries drawn by colonial powers, and past interference by the great powers (the US installing the Shah in Iran and the British and then the Russians in Afghanistan) explains much of today; but no solution rests in dissecting this history. We need pragmatism"

('only' a thousand deaths in BC last year, by the way). Yet, she has a ""rare-rish"" inflammatory desease - something that also occurs in relatively low numbers.  Should we therefore apply the same disregard for her own condition?

She doesn't ackowledge that over-prescribed pain meds can lead to addiction and dependency, which can cause the user to seek out illicit sources, tumbling further and further into a hole from which there is no escape.  The chinese stuff is what they buy after the doctor no longer acquiesces.

Street junkies are using fentanyl to escape some sort of pain as well. She has more in common with them than she realizes."

"The problem of fringe parties gaining parliamentary leverage is easily solved in a carefully crafted PR model.  Mr. Trudeau expresses a very narrow, limited view of what a PR model is.  PR is not necessarily one model.  There are many PR models available for consideration - it would be the job of parliamentarians and constitutional experts to analyse and recommend the best one.  The common reference to PR implementations in other countries is interesting, but I believe that Canada should design its own PR model rather than adopt another existing model and then try to shoehorn it into the Canadian culture.  Surely Canadians are smart enough to create a Made In Canada system of government."
"Hi, Disconcerted.  Well, your reasons for ""staying the course"" are more reasoned and pragmatic than the reasons given to us (second-hand) by the man who made the original election promise (see Gould's letter.)

"'doctors and nurses ...are quite as cable to judge and apply ethical reasoning as anyone else'
Sprietsma, you are probably right, but the difference is that doctors are the gatekeepers to prescription contraception.  And I can tell you from personal experience that the vast majority of doctors (I am one) and nurses (I dated several, and married one) simply don’t have the aptitude or the intellectual grounding to deal with this issue. 

Most doctors are like everyone else—they absorb their sense of morality from the prevailing culture.  When the culture is decadent, and modern western culture is decadent, those are the ethics they conform to.

'As to application of ethics to the ethics of their own profession, probably they are more competent than those who know little about medical matters.'
Again, contraception is not medicine."

beneficial and cost effective in the middle of the Pacific. 
Astronomy in Hawai'i is a resource to be developed and leveraged here

"Usually, if you're in a special situation (with infants, or with large luggage or a large instrument), you cannot use the automated check-in machines. I have had this issue flying with a Cello (that I bought a seat for) and with someone that required accommodations (pre booked). Also worth noting, you cannot pre-book seats selection if a leg of your flight is booked through another star alliance member, no matter how much you want to pay. The only way to *try* to get around this is by buying business class tickets and getting the airline to try to accommodate you with phone tag (i do not recommend) because they're just more helpful with business class. This is a pain in the ass with international flights because even though you may book a flight through Air Canada, or Lufthansa, the flight may be actually run by Swiss or any other Star Alliance member. And no, it makes no sense to book each leg with a different airline, you'll end up pay 5-10k for a flight."
Lynne Curry you do harm by spreading misinformation about child pornography recidivism rates. I have worked on this particular issue and the fact is the recidivism rate for child pornography is low and the truth is there are people on the sex offender list (for child pornography) that should not be on the sex offender list and yet their lives have been destroyed because of it. Not every individual on the sex offender list is a threat and not every individual on that list should be on the list.

The lesson that life is cheap and expendable is learned by all.  Your praise of police for not killing instead of demanding routine tactics aimed specifically at avoiding death, demonstrates how civilians learn to little regard the lives of anybody who gets in their way.

"And Ideological Compromise;

There is one thing Hillarycrats and Trumpstercons can all agree on and that is the fact that conservatives think liberty starts with the individual and liberals with groups of individuals. 
As a consequence liberals and conservatives think differently and live their lives differently because the world of left vs. right ideology is Humanity's herd mentality gene of our DNA that keeps us from evolving as an intelligent species. 

Liberals need to “believe” in something, just ""anything"", instead of just blindly “moving forward” in any direction having faith that somewhere out there is a perfect Utopia and conservatives need to dump the primal grunt of; “God” so Humans can let reason lead us to fairness and equality. 
Otherwise we are still hanging in the trees."

"So which is worse for the Alaska economy: budget and PFD cuts, or income taxes? 
Budget and PFD cuts are worse. Analysis by economists at ISER shows that, under low and high scenarios, $500 million in progressive income taxes will cost the Alaska economy between 2,720 and 3,930 full-time-equivalent (FTE) jobs; permanent fund dividend cuts cost between 2,790 and 4,460 FTEs; and broad-based state budget cuts take out 4,900 to 6,300 jobs. 
   There are three reasons that income taxes have a lighter economic impact than the other two strategies: 1. Over 20 percent of our workforce is nonresidents; under HB 115 they would contribute $80 million to help support the roads, airports and services they use; 2. progressive taxes have a higher economic multiplier than regressive taxes; and 3. income taxes paid to the state are deductible against the federal income tax.

My suggestion would be to have all of them get put on Suboxone (for opioid addicts) and have them start on it before they get to the island. I have no idea if it works for meth or other drugs, it might because what it does is to block the part of the brain where the cravings are. I think a community away from everything except the basic necessities of life where they have to build, grow, fish, and gather would work for those who have seriously decided they want to live. My opinion is that most addicts are committing a slow suicide and as they do, they put their loved ones through hell as well as others in the communities. They have to decide that they want to live and that means getting off the drugs and alcohol. I am sorry for sister, she is very lucky to have you!"
"The Bank of Canada being as opaque as it is, it only provides charts and not tables in its outlook document. Even so, it is clear that business expected a lot more inflation at the time of this winter survey than they did in the fall. Around 80% expect CPI inflation to exceed the 2% target as opposed to around 70% three months previous. Dave mentions this being the first survey since the election of Donald Trump but Trump’s name isn’t mentioned in the outlook document at all. However, independent of Trump’s election, it is likely that the increasing probability of a federal funds rate increase and then the actuality of one over the survey period led respondents to anticipate higher inflation. This interest rate rise, which will almost certainly not be matched by the Bank of Canada, will certainly have an inflationary impact over much of 2017."

"I wish I understood their logic.  They say that they want to make sure that vaping is accessible to adult smokers, and I believe them, but this bill removes important characteristics that make vaping successful. Every vaper I know has a collection of different flavours, because adults like fruit, candy and dessert as much as young people, but this bill would ban such flavours.  Vaping has spread quickly through word of mouth and Facebook, but the bill would make it a criminal offense to say that it's safer and more pleasant than smoking. They say that they want to make sure that Canadian regulations reflect science, but ignore much of the international research showing that vaping is vastly safer than smoking to both the individual and his/her surroundings and that vaping is not proving to be a gateway to tobacco.

This undoubtedly entails a lot of complexity, extra work and sources for potential confusion for the individuals, their First Nation community and the general society.

If government wants to invest in EVs, there are two sensible courses of action.  First, encourage private industry to invest in supporting infrastructure.  We need quick charge stations along our major highways, since range anxiety is stopping many people from considering EVs.  Second, invest in post secondary research projects to improve batteries.

If we must subsidize purchases, let’s do it by waiving the GST or offering interest free loans.  Direct payment to owners is unfair to those that cannot profit from the advantages of owning an EV.  Sort the range problems through robust infrastructure and improved batteries, and the market will take care of itself.  Subsidize well-heeled owners and EVs will remain a niche product."

"""But the fact that only a few reporters decided to print these rumours in their entirety PROVES [capitals = my emphasis] just the opposite: that the vast majority of American publications – even ones Mr. Trump usually dislikes! – aren’t out to get him, but that they’re simply out to tell the truth, when they can verify it.""

Actually, this one incident does not PROVE anything.  It simply represents evidence on one side of the case for journalists being interested in telling the truth.  The completely illegitimate use of the word ""proves"", in that context, constitutes evidence on the other side of that case."

"Just a point about relocation. It has been found both in the Banff and Jasper Park areas that relocation often doesn't work, and is very costly. Bears that are tranquilized have been taken 20 , 30 , and 40 miles away and collared and released. The distance often determines just how long it takes for the animal to return to the townsite. This process is not repeated over and over , but instead after returning two to three times the animal is euthanized to avoid any problem encounters with humans."

"The SR&ED program along with NRC's IRAP are the best incentive programs in North America.  It was sickening that the previous federal government decreased SR&ED funding so drastically. Most of our government, government funded organizations and so many venture funds completely lack understanding of the creative process, innovation and entrepreneurship. We can compete in any area that Silicon Valley innovates in. Unfortunately financing institutions, Canadian venture capital and our core society are ultra conservative ; we are not a country of people that take risks and people are not willing to work around the clock intensely, sacrificing having a life ""balance"". Every day I keep finding that too many people are closed minded, don't care about excellence and are simply protective of their jobs.  Thankfully other people I do meet who share a passion for excellence, creativity, innovation and excellence compensate for those who don't.

"Every week as I stand in line at the supermarket I shake my head when I see what is being bought by so many families.  I doubt 1 out of eight of these customers are using food stamps as I can easily watch the cashiers and the customers transactions.  Most of what I notice is fast food items and not individual ingredients. It is more like standing in line at a McDonald's when you see  the microwaveable breakfast and no plain old groceries to make a breakfast.  Stacks of potato-chips and cases of pop  outnumber  other items parents are loading on the belts.

It a great result of the volume of TV ads showing how dad can toss in a pop tart for the kids and be done in 30 seconds with feeding the kids.  In the evening just head some hamburger helper in a few minutes and that satisfies the entire family.  

Unfortunately when it comes to the food stamp buyers it is  easy to find items meeting the list of acceptable items in the quick fix ready to eat isles. Besides who teaches kids to cook?"

Trump must fire the special prosecutor, declare himself emperor for life, outlaw the democratic party and implement tax cuts by fiat before it's too late! Special prosecutor why isn't he focused on the real story which is Hillary Clinton and all her misdeeds. 30 years of feverish talk radio inspired anticipation and she still isn't in jail! What's up with that you guys!
If Trump isn't shown the deference and respect he deserves, he may just take his incredible dealmaking abilities and business acumen back to the private sector. Where would America be then? Won't someone think of the 1% and the massive tax cuts they need to make America great again??"
"Morneau is right on this one and I do not believe it will cause many doctors to leave. The tax system must be applied fairly and equally to all, doctors are no exception.

IF this is going to cause an exodus, stopping it has to be addressed some other way.  The tax policy is sound."

"Yes, I am ""fearful"" of Donald Trump becoming president. I want gay people to continue to be able to get married, I want women to be able to continue to get abortions, and most importantly, I want climate change to be addressed. The official Republican platform would ban gay marriages, ban abortion, and do absolutely nothing about climate change. Climate change is by far the greatest threat to the world and will negatively affection hundreds of millions of people if we do not start acting. Millions of women and homosexuals will be negatively affected by marriage bans and abortion bans.

So yes you are absolutely correct, I ""fear"" that the official Republican platform would be implemented, which in turn would have a very negative, very real effect on millions of people's everyday lives. In my opinion, Obama has done a fairly excellent job, implementing near universal health care, granting civil rights to homosexuals, and turning around the economy. I'm fine with more of that."

The article also points out that one generation ago the prevailing belief (also by economists and also backed by decades of research) showed different results.  

The article also uses the term ""moderate increases"" repeatedly... a 30+% increase in 18 months is not exactly ""moderate"".  If your family food bill increased from $400/month to $525/month, I doubt you'd be so dismissive of a ""moderate"" increase; same if gas went from $1.00 to $1.31. I remember that last one happening and doomsaying was the result along with definable shifts in spending and a ripple effect of increased costs... but this time when businesses costs to do business increase, it will be different, eh?

In other words, it was eight years during which the media (which was now rotten from top to bottom with former Bush Administration speech writers, toadies and water boys) let the Right get away with more and more brazen lies and openly treasonous behaviors while ever more aggressively marginalizing the dirty Liberals who were warning (just as they had in 1994 and 2000 and 2004) that letting Republicans lie with impunity about the disasters they were creating and the conspiracies they were concocting and the scapegoats and straw-men they were inventing would lead to disaster.

He still managed to get about 20% of the vote, in spite of all the negative ads Rove and McConnell paid for with lobbyist money. Roy Moore has a strong base of support. They will come to the polls to vote in the run off. Most of his voters are Trump supporters. Luther is a weak candidate. This author is clueless and delusional. Trump is strong here in Alabama. McConnell and Rove are not. Luther is McConnell's candidate and we know it. Getting his vote out and picking up enough votes to beat Roy Moore will be very difficult."

"Exactly.  Canada for good or ill has swung leftward over the past five years so electing another Harper won't work in the short-run.  Yes Harper's policies were reasonably popular about a decade ago but politics goes in cycles and we are in a left wing phase now meaning the political centre is the furthest right one can be and still win.  Attitudes towards deficits, taxes, government spending, and role of government according to most polls have taken a sharp turn left and since Harper didn't adjust he lost.  Yes eventually the pendulum will swing back but that is probably a few elections away."

"No, it isn't. Volunteering, helping friends and neighbors and cleaning your house are examples of services provided without the profit motive.  One of the reasons the Canadian system is cheaper is because it runs at cost without having to make money to give to shareholders.

I might add that I have no problem with profit in many sectors and was actually in business myself for a long time. The evidence is that the American system costs more however, and profit is a significant cause. Someone unlucky enough to need medical attention should not end up broke so someone else can profit."

"Bottled water is one of the most wasteful habits this country has. In a time of cheap oil, plastic bottles aren't recycled but end up in landfills or cast into the environment. Even in times when it is more expensive, less than 40% of these billions of single usage bottles are ever recycled. That's a huge amount of wasted plastic. Combine that with the energy it takes to transport water at seven pounds per gallon, distances of thousands miles(Fiji water actually comes all the way from Fiji!) and we waste vast resources and create a huge amount of solid waste. It is also ridiculous to spend five dollars a gallon on water  which is usually the same quality that can be purchased locally for around twenty dollars for a thousand gallons. Buy inexpensive reusable bottles, fill them from the tap. If you are concerned for some reason about water quality, buy a water filter. Over the years, you will save thousands of dollars and do your part to reduce waste and pollution."

"No, it's tying it to the market price of a traded commodity. Mind you, the chances of this hitting the completely pulled out of no where $90/bbl benchmark is slim to none in the next five years barring a major geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. This is a way to stick it to the state employees who are vilified for who knows what reason, but makes for good radio chatter. 

If the state runs a balanced budget, through PFD restructuring, new revenues (taxes!), and strategic cuts we can get back to fiscal solvency. This can happen without the price of Alaska crude hitting $90/bbl leaving state employees stagnant on merit and more than likely turned over year over year. 

If they want to be serious about merit raise freezes, they need to benchmark it in a way that actually makes sense."

"Actually in the shady world of back-room politics, the lawsuit makes perfect sense.  Yes it is about the money, on the surface.

There are certainly more accurate phrases but this is a family paper and the idea is to be civil.

The Japanese and Hawaiian culture called it a 'Hui'.  It is defined; partnership, syndicate, or an association of like minded business partners.  Partners who seek to control and profit by clandestine agreements in some cases.  A more common term is 'corruption'.  This is what this entire debacle was all about, politicians providing favors to financial political supporters.   All done with other people's money, and against the regulations of the very system they swore to abide by.

I wonder now about just how many of those same politicians are pushing Pfeffer and Acree to sue the State as retribution?  Surely not????????"
"All workers deserve to have the right-to-choose if they want to financially support a labor union OR NOT, and that's probably why a widely reported 82% of Americans are opposed to Forced Unionism.

"""Why is real estate purchased for long-term hold so sinister ... but paying 23X for the S&P for long term hold is OK?""

Well, for one, becuase interest rates are already rising and will continue to rise over the next few years, making mortgage payments more expensive.  And, according to the numerous studies, most people can't afford that.

Secondly, by purchasing real estate, people are gambling with about 20 years of income.  those stakes are way too big for anyone to be playing with.

Finally, any rationale person can take a look at this market and determine that it is poised to collapse.  There is no way these prices are sustainable or justified.

Any other questions?"

Assessments may increase, but the MILL RATE (look it up!) will be adjusted so the total tax paid will be roughly the same.

Municipal taxes are calculated in reverse - the mill rate is established so when multiplied by the assessments in the City, the City raises the total desired for its budget.

"""WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump is leaning toward naming as secretary of state John Bolton, a bellicose enemy of Russia and Iran who is among the most hawkish members of the Republican foreign policy community, according to two sources familiar with Trump’s thinking...“While Mr. Obama sleepwalks, Mr. Putin is ardently pursuing Russia’s Middle East objectives,” Bolton wrote in a 2013 op ed that argued against assuming the U.S. has common interests with Russia in Syria. 

In 2014, speculating that Russia was responsible for the downing of a Malaysian plane over Ukraine, Bolton told Fox News, “I think we’ve got to begin to treat Russia like the adversary that Putin is currently demonstrating it to be.”

"The majority of states chose Trump.  That is our government, a Constitutional Republic.  To the best of my knowledge the majority of the free world does not choose their President, Prime Minister, etc.... by popular vote.  Those leaders are chosen by the party that controls their legislature or parliament.  

The President is the head of our 50 United States (not regions) and responsible for the execution and enforcement of the laws created by the congressional representatives and senators from each of those 50 states.

It's been a couple weeks since I looked at the numbers, but at the end of November, if you take away California, Trump wins the popular vote.  Mr. Hansen has a point that with a popular vote the west coast (and northeast) would decide elections. In essence the other states wouldn't need to vote because they know what is best for all.  That is mob rule."

"I completely agree.  I don't understand why the promoters of a plan divorcing the dividend from any relation to the performance of the Permanent Fund have failed to explain why they think it is good policy. Is it because they know that, once the dividend has no relation to the Permanent Fund, Alaskans will pay less and less attention to it, and then the real raid on the Permanent Fund can begin in earnest?  

If this was all about budget math, why wouldn't ""Alaska's Future (except mine)"" promote a plan that continues to use today's methodology for calculating the Permanent Fund dividend and provides for it to be capped annually by an act of the Legislature?  This approach would yield the same bottom line with respect to the amount of excess Permanent Fund earnings being spent on state services and dividends, while maintaining Alaskans' interest in the Permanent Fund, and a desire to keep it permanent."

It remains to be seen what the outcome will be on this approach. Either way Canada needs to ensure it is protecting it's own interests as best as possible in any type of trade arrangement. It's silly to suggest Canada & Mexico should stand together. As a country Canada needs to protect it's own interests and try to ensure any trade pact is reasonably equitable.

With trade countries will always try to further their own interests the danger is when those interests become too insular. We need to continually evaluate whether trade arrangements are beneficial; this goes for all countries. Being complacent on prior arrangements is not an option. Canadians need to stand together let's hope our negotiators keep our interests intact."

That's 3x more bullets than people.  Or how the Department of Education needed Glock handguns with high-capacity magazines and Remington Pump shotguns.  The DoE doesn't even run a single school.  They are mostly an education standards and finance organization.  I guess you never know when one of those no-good kids is going to try to welch on their student loans."

Don't worry a large part of the solution in reducing the anxiety epidemic and I'm serious is to vote the Liberal governments out in Ontario and in Ottawa and start to get their fiscal houses in order along with an emphasis on promoting businesses and cutting government pensions and salaries and personnel and regulations that are killing our country and not allowing us to compete on the world stage.
"I don't think influence peddling by Trump's family is ""fluff."" I think it is a high crime and misdemeanor.

Here's the definition by the way: ""The charge of high crimes and misdemeanors covers allegations of misconduct peculiar to officials, such as perjury of oath, abuse of authority, bribery, intimidation, misuse of assets, failure to supervise, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming, and refusal to obey a lawful order."""

So, there will be alternatives on about the same time scale as building a giant system.  The giant system is definitely risky."
"Hi Dartguard - I'm not the least surprised your Doctor brother is miffed and writing cheques for the Cons.  The Cons have always out performed everyone else in fundraising.  They are masters at misrepresenting facts and hitting emotional hot button issues.

The fact Morneau did not expect opposition from the ""we don't want to pay any taxes"" lobby is incredible.  The Conservative media and groups like Fraser Institute and The Canadian Taxpayers Federation LIVE for fights like the Liberals handed them.

Plus it was not handled well, not publicized at all perhaps because it was initiated as a discussion piece to collect opinions before anything was written as a law (which would still require 3 votes in the house and the same in the Senate).

"Agreed - terrorism is a specific kind of violence and should be understood and analyzed as such. Acts of terror have a political goal that stretches beyond the immediate localized consequences of the violence. Terrorists specifically target places and people, and orchestrate their attacks, to generate maximum media attention and cause a maximum public reaction. To say that ""every mass shooting is terrorism"" is false. Some gangster doing a drive-by on several enemies is not terrorism. Those people don't have political aims and don't care how the general public reacts. A mental case killing their spouse and children is not terrorism. Analyzing motivations and categorizing these attacks *is* a useful and valid exercise especially for law enforcement agencies. It helps them know how to utilize and divert investigative and community outreach resources.

Sure it doesn't have that feel good let's-condemn-everything-equally quality to it, but categorizing these things is valid and necessary."

"This point below might explain the gap of understanding that we have. 

My view is that each Christian should feel greater responsibility for the state of the soul of every person in the world, than most people do.  (and there should be no ""zero sum"" view of responsibility.  No lessening.

There is a secular view hat exists today that tries to assign and overly narrow responsibility....or to blame even more abstractly.

In some fashion or other, how you live your faith affects my ability to live my faith.  And vice versa, of course.

Grace and prayer operate on the supernatural plane...and if we see things with mere human eyes..we tend to ""shrink"" responsibility.

God grants and distributes graces as He chooses.  This understanding of course underlies two marvelous aspects of our Catholic Faith: Intercessory prayer and the Communion of Saints.

You do all the right things with your health and still get cancer .  A lot of people who eat poorly and don't exercise have health insurance through their employer already so it's not just people who have to buy their own health insurance have a monopoly on a bad life style .

You see the whole concept of insurance is a Socialist program of the many taking care of the few .

As for the Rox going forward, they don't need to trade for Giancarlo Stanton (never happen anyway), they just need to cut down on the strikeouts and improve their situational hitting, especially by Desmond, Story and even LaMahieu.  They DO need to add a bullpen arm or a veteran starter if they can, though knowing the reluctance of the Rox to trade for pitching, I'm not holding my breath."

"It's awful. A beloved cousin of mine died last Winter, leaving a husband and daughter who are also struggling.  And even so, I've got to note the recent shift in tone with respect to drug abuse. In the '80s and '90s it was all about the moral depravity of those caught up in the crack crisis. I don't recall there being much attention paid to the economic and social struggles of those afflicted. Instead, we changed our laws so we could charge and sentence mentally retarded children as adults, built prisons for profit, and militarized the policing of suffering neighborhoods. 

I'm glad there's a general will to see people caught up in opioid addiction as human beings. But I am saddened to think that they are being extended that consideration primarily because so many of them are White (USA Today reports it at 90%) I will celebrate more heartily when that  same compassion and sense societal responsibility is brought to bear on  problems afflicting communities of color."

"It would nonetheless be refreshing for Trudeau to describe it as a team effort with his advisors, rather than, as he does so often, mugging the cameras to give a histrionic, dramatic display of acting the big leader man.

I suspect that you (very understandably and reasonably) favor President Obama over Trump.

Terrific, and Obama is a case in point of what I am getting at: Obama had no need or compulsion to give histrionic, dramatic displays of acting the big leader man and, indeed, he frequently acknowledged in his speeches the contributions and sacrifices by others, and in leaving office Obama even thanked the American people for making him 'a better man'.

When a scientist gives a speech about the lab's directions and accomplishments, she or he typically names each contributor and their ideas. For a prime minister who says he salutes evidence based, scientific approaches and those who take them, he falls short in the expected and appropriate protocol. Always the drama teacher."
"Yes, it's an important book for many reasons.  It's extremely well-researched and annotated almost to the point of tedium -- except, of course, that the documentation is essential for credibility.  We need a similar book to give us a fuller picture than we have now about Pope Pius XII.  Pope Francis should act immediately to make all of the relevant archival material available to historians and researchers.
The religious leaders of our day, especially in the United States, would do well to remember that a future generation of historians will study the resurgence of Nazism, fascism and racism under Donald Trump. A good exercise for them would be to write the chapter they hope will be written about them.  History will ask: Where were you, what did you say and do, to stand against the reemergence of fascism?"

If the law is to function it's has to be based on full disclosure for both the hospice and the patients so everyone knows what they are getting at the start.  There will be hiccups along the way, but there is no reason this can't work out to everyone's benefit."

How times change.  All throughout the cold war American leftists looked longingly to the Soviet Union. (that's Russia for those of you educated in public schools.)  Why you ask?  Because the Soviets communists were building heaven on earth.  Starry eyed progressives saw the world's largest big government mommy and daddy who looked out for all needs while the common people wanted for nothing.  In reality the Soviet Union was the world's largest police state where walls were built not to keep people put but to prevent them from escaping.

"Taxing capital gains on a Canadian citizens' house is a crazy idea.  Imagine a family having to upsize or downsize to a bigger house either due to a job relocation or change in family composition.  Housing prices, much like everything else, has always gone up.  Are we to create a disincentive or penalize people who move due to circumstances beyond their control?

Introduce a foreign buyers tax and restrict foreign ownership of residential properties.  That will ensure that Canadians do not have to compete with the global market for housing.  We all know that housing is critical for the local population, so why are we letting foreign speculators skew our housing prices.  Who has Canada's best interest for the long term?  Foreign speculators or citizens who live and work here?

Governments building affordable housing without addressing foreign buyers is also not the best idea.  It will simply be an endless cycle of shoveling more taxpayers' money down a bottomless pit."

"Bill, I think you are strictly framing journalism as a profession rather than considering journalism as an ideology, and a way of being in the world, and understanding the world. In the latter perspective, which I recommend highly, comments are a part of journalistic discourses. They share the same basic space (physically and conceptually), so they should have some fundamental standards. My argument is really simple. If you work for (or lobby for) a particular special-interest group, then you should disclose that background when you comment on that particular topic. If you do not, you inherently present yourself as something you are not, unaffiliated and independent (of the substructure you belong to). ... And in terms of being your Reader Rep, whether you agree with me or not, my role is to prompt and foster these types of important societal discussions.

"I totally agree. I've also found that that is generally the case for the men who are priests, at least with women. They are grateful enough if women apologize for some misunderstanding between them and act as though they are glad that they've learned what Jesus had in mind, but they don't initiate it even though they were the one who wronged. Women are supposed to do their emotional work for them, then be patronized by them for the effort. If priests fix the relationship problem, it is only by acting as though it no longer happened. The exception seems to be those who have sisters and have a better idea of being a part of a family instead of being a favored eldest or only son.


That, I think, is at the heart of the clerical problem, then magnified and concretized by being brought into a man-club with its bonds. They just see themselves as presenting the way to live and forget that we expect them to live by it even if they don't have that expectation."

But I don't doubt one bit that this is a minor showing of what will come as growers and retailers get their systems and markets worked, more businesses come on line and then there is canbi-tourism. But regardless, the state is making some money, businesses are legitimate and cops are free to deal with real issues."

"Since you can't deduct interest paid from your income in the case of personal loans (mortgages, vehicles, lines of credit, credit cards), you should always pay off debt first. Interest paid, amounts to money flushed down the toilet.

Interest paid is money thats gone and you can never get it back, no matter how hard you try twisting the interest rate factor around. All you end up doing is believing a fiction.

The more money you put towards personal loans the less of your money that will disappear, never to be seen from again in interest payments.

"I agree that the minimum wage has not kept up with the costs of living and by the inaction of the politicians over the years.  I read another opinion that if the minimum wage kept up since it's creation in the 1930's it would be 28. an hour. Poverty has decreased in this nation since President Johnson has waged the war on poverty but the safety net is necessary to keep people from being poor. Experts say the poor are those who are working minimum wage jobs so until the minimum wages are increased there will be no way to change that.  Workers being threatened to be replaced by machines if they ask for a living wage and benefits sounds more like a scene  out of a  George Orwell book. It is not new, if employers want to have machines do the work loyal employees will not stop them. There has to be a ladder up to the middle class and better paying jobs and that includes low college tuition and on the job training for technical jobs. Same as in my day."

2. ""His guilt as a killer"" was not determined by American courts.  He is challenging this guilty plea (after a decade in jail) on the basis of duress.  Wherever that appeal will go, the basis of the settlement was Canada's violations, not his supposed 'guilt.'

3.  Correct that no Canadian court ordered a financial payout, but the basis for that compensation (Canada's liability for the Charter violations) was confirmed in 2010.

4.  Parties to litigation should settle - as the Supreme Court itself says:
"". . . the courts consistently favour the settlement of lawsuits in general. To put it another way, there is an overriding public interest in favour of settlement. This policy promotes the interests of litigants generally by saving them the expense of trial of disputed issues, and it reduces the strain upon an already overburdened provincial court system."""

Forcing others to pay for your idea of beautification is tyrannical and despotic. Shame, shame, shame."
"Without Free Trade we would be less prosperous. Prosperity is what convinces people the value of economic policies. When the first Free Trade agreement with the U.S.A. was the ""dominant"" election issue in 1988, Liberals and New Democrats declared that it would ""ruin"" the country and make us simply a puppet for the U.S.A.. Lots of them even had tears in their eyes as they predicted American troops would be coming across the border because of Free Trade. They thought Canada would be too economically tempting for the U.S.A.. to resist. Well, Liberals love free trade nowadays and if the NDP had won  the last election, they wouldn't have touched things.
Oh and I'm a middle-class fellow myself."

"I have never heard so much talk about skin colour as something that distinguishes one human being from another in my life--and it is not a positive thing and it is not all the fault of Trump.

I would first consider asking my former employer to document my prior salary before I'd provide a W2.  The information on the W2 contains far more information such as withholding amounts that I find no employer needs to know. Also not the above article is not legal advice so it did not render any thing more than an unqualified opinion as to the legality of the potential new  employers request.
"C'mon, Bozo, I've never advocated everyone moving to Texas.  I was just making the point to show that the Earth isn't over-populated.  We only have 10% of the population density of Europe's, but ours is quite a bit more dense that Russia's.  We have a lot of arid and semi-arid land that could be made productive if we ever decide it's worth the cost to bring desalinated water to it.  The Earth ain't running out of water any time soon."
"I don't believe this is as simple as an exclusively male problem, I have worked for both men and women who have abused their power, it just happens in different ways.

I've had experience with both having gone to a convent school for several years and worked for and with many men and women."

"You are paid $2,000 to $4,000 per course which are rated at about 6 hours of work per week including classsroom hours, office hours and grading. The real time can be higher if preparing slides for a new course and if you commute to multiple schools. For a 15-20 week course this about $18 to $40 an hour.
Most schools limit instructors to less than 20 booked hours per week in order to avoid paying benefits like health insurance and sick days. So the trick is getting enough courses over a year to make a living wage. Five courses per semester is pushing it, giving the instructor $20K to $40K a year, of which you pay your benefits. And you may have to spread these courses over 2 or 3 schools due to the part time rules. If you are lucky you might get a MWF set one place and TuTh elsewhere. Or a daytime/ evening split. The name of the game is hustle, hustle, hustle."
"LOL Brett liked this comment, which tells me everything.  He has fully bought into the Russian propaganda narrative, hook, line, and sinker.

Anyone who believes that ""fake news"" is actually ""news"" is someone who is completely and utterly brainwashed by mainstream news propaganda.  There is no other explanation.  This is only ""news"" because they say it's ""news.""  You only believe it because they told you so and no other reason.  You would not have otherwise arrived to this conclusion independently.  You would have simply recognized click-bait and something that's always been there and ignored it.

"Sometimes the safety of the consumer needs to be put ahead of the privacy of the employee.  Airline pilots are a prime axample of this.   Whether it is a mental health issue or alcohol consumption issue the passengers expect healthy sober pilots and the unions involved need to protect everyone, not just their members.  Of course that will never happen which is why unions are a disgrace to the modern employment framework...they outlived their usefulness a century ago!"
"Looks like my patience served to smoke out your retort to any reply I could make to your hypothetical question. I saw where you were going. My reply now is that carelessness itself, in my limited experience, goes unpunished among underlings unless it results in a leak or breach, or unless someone higher in the chain of command wants the ""careless"" person to be cashiered for some other reason.  This would be the case in Clinton vs her enemies in Congress. In this case, Congress (meaning Chuck Grassley) had to go through Comey, who refused to be a tool of partisan pressure, at least to that degree. In that scenario, Comey played his hand well, denying the assassins access to any legal justification for censure or worse.

""What ifs"" are fine for mind games, but in this circumstance, Hillary Clinton, doing as her predecessors did, likewise suffered no security breach. No harm, no blame.  Have a good evening."

"Do the math people. These people don't work, they are homeless! Yet you see them smoking and drinking. Where does that money come from?? It isn't coming from handouts!! I don't want them anywhere near my kids or my home. The park by my kids school had such a problem with homeless they came in and cut down a bunch of trees. They moved to the other side. They cut those trees out. The team that cleaned the park said they took out over 200 needles, condemns, drug paraphernalia, and bags of biohazard garbage. This park is behind a big church, on the side of a busy street and next to a good neighborhood. Their street corners are disgusting, imagine their camps!! They choose drugs & drink. They aren't trying to get a job.  
I agree getting teens off the street is important. They are easy prey & they don't have safe places to go. Most don't have safe homes. They need shelter, food, school and a support network. Kids don't necessarily have a choice, adult homeless CHOOSE to stay homeless."

"The issue initially may have been Russia joining NATO(, but it quickly dissolved into a ""bash Russia"" thread NOT a fair discussion of pros/cons, so turnabout is fair play. To Hamilton's key point:
""Instead of posturing and demonizing Russia, invite Russia to join NATO, and make it a serious offer.""

If NATO is to continue, then this is a sane and sensible idea, and will never happen as long as the US is dead set on global domination, militarily, economically, and politically. Putin is no angel( who of the major power leaders is?), but he does have a sense of reality and he's probably a whole easier to deal with than whoever will follow him. 

Since the US virtually owns NATO, what the other country's citizens think about it doesn't even come up for discussion. The threat of a nuclear war between super powers is vastly more threatening to their health than any fantasy of Russian tanks steamrolling through Europe, and most of them know it even oh so many here don't."

"One has to wonder about CRA. Their analysis and approach on Canadian Controlled Private Corporations was awful regardless of what you might think about the policy position. And changing the bar on employee discounts from below-cost to less-than-publicly-available-discounts wonders who the hell championed this turkey within CRA. The test might have been raised to fair market value but that is just as hard to determine as publically available discounts. Below cost is a much easier test. 

From a political viewpoint why the hell go after hard working employees when we have a lot to be concerned about in the real estate market and off shore money.  CRA bureaucrats wake up!"

"The eminence grise of the most dialogue happy publication in Catholicism/pseudo-Catholicism arguing against dialogue! Oh, how rich the irony!

He is right, of course. Neither Pope Francis nor the Church has much to gain. In the wildly libertine culture that permeates the US, and the West generally, it is nice to have a few other defenders of basic Christian morality, but this bunch has adulterated that morality with such a mix of anti-Catholic ideas on the death penalty and immigration that the result is a brew noxious to all but themselves.

"America's problem with health care goes beyond HMSA.  Costs for treatment are wildly out of line in America versus the rest of the world, and they constantly increase.  Hence HMSA is always raising its rates or trying to control costs.  At the same time, the last thing we need is an insurance company determining how health care is delivered.  They're more interested in the financial bottom line than they are in individual patients.  Some people will scream and shout about this, but the only way to solve this problem is to go to single payer health care in the Medicare model and for the government to start regulating medical and drug costs.  Otherwise, the costs of health care will continue to rise until only the wealthiest can afford it.  Some might argue that it's already reached that point."

In the same way with love or even with ideas such as ""the good"".  We had an idea of love before Jesus came into the world.  We were attracted to it...because it came from God! 

But Jesus perfected it, and He showed us how to love. 

Jesus brought all these imperfect ideas of justice, redemption, mercy, and love into the highest perfection and completed unity on the Cross and in the Resurrection.

Some other folks on here who know a ton more than I do about them talk about some newer technologies in reactors that are much safer, but we never hear about them in relation to building a new plant, it is always, the same tech that we have been using since the 1960s."

"I think the police are always behind the curve when it comes to human rights.  I agree with the ban in theory to the extent that it forces groups, such as the police, to examine their institution for a culture of homophobia, racism, and sexism, all of which have existed within police culture for time immemorial.  Marching in the pride parade gives organizations a cheap way to posture and co-opt a message of inclusivity without having to earn that respect.  Even Patrick Brown marches in the pride parade while courting all sorts of unsavory hardline social conservatives.   Enough is enough, it's their parade, not ours.  Toronto police can march, just not in an organized manner in uniform.  That's a legitimate compromise, but it takes power away from an organization used to having it and abusing it."
"Just the opposite Charlie. As far as taste...well you support Trump...who we all know, is a great example of good taste...and fine dining..

"Anti-bullying policies should be for everybody, without special reference to any group or political movement. The need to refer to ""transgender"" is unnecessary and frankly discriminates against non-transgenders. I am a transgender, but was bullied far more in school before I came out, and I am sick of people trying to indoctrinate children by forcing transgenderism into our schools and sexualizing our children. I lived without transitioning as a child and I think the decision should be reserved for adults (just like we do not let kids drink or consent to have sex with adults). And all of these transgender specific policies are just thinly veiled programs designed to program children into making adult choices when they are still highly influenceable kids. I did not need policies to make me more comfortable as a transgender; I needed policies to protect me from vicious people irregardless of my identity. So I wish they would stop putting subclauses in everything."

We have many checks and balances with the Parliamentary system that will ensure that no party in power is too extreme. FPTP has served us well for 150 years. I would be happy to consider something better - when I see it."

"The concept of ""intrinsic disorder"" has a certain internal consistency within the system that gives rise to the term.  Precisely because it does, it underscores that it is not only, not even so much, the church's teaching about homosexuality that needs renewal and revision, but rather the church's entire understanding of human sexuality.  The good news is that the theological, anthropological, sociological, and scientific groundwork is already available; the bad news is that the current teaching is entrenched within a larger framework that claims, incredibly, that the church cannot change its teaching."
"That is why the spruce bark beetle got spread far and wide on the Kenai,  The Division of Forestry in their wisdom opened up firewood cutting for free and every one flocked to get it and stacked it nice an neat underneath their healthy live trees.

"Hi! Scott, thank you for your comment
Genesis
""Be fruitful and multiply,
Psalm 127:3
“Behold, children are a gift of the LORD, The fruit of the womb is a reward”.

Onan wasted his seed on the ground in a Self-Serving act (Sinful,) what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; so He took his life, as he had taken Er, Judah's firstborn who was evil in the sight of the LORD also.
 His sin became known as ""Onanism,""
Contraception was so far outside the biblical mind-set and so obviously wrong that it did not need the frequent condemnations other sins did, as the gift of new life was seen as a blessing (Approval ) from God.

We see this in the statement by Jesus below, as it amplifies the mind-set of some of those who now teach in His name in duplicity “Blessed are the barren” In Approval of those who while partaking with our Creator in His Plan for new life, commit a deliberate act, of denying another the possibility of life.

"It strikes me that there is nothing in this article representing the point of view of people in the park or those who are knowledgeable about what has gone on there, some of whom have posted here and could be contacted by the RG. No, not me, but others who have actually spent time there and talked to the people, who I understand are mostly homeless, who hang out there.

Regardless of who is ""right"" about what happened, when something as controversial as this happens, it seems like the RG should be obligated to get more than one side of the story. Very lazy, one-sided reporting. The RG has shed no light on the situation downtown, why there is conflict, or what needs to be done about it. This is typical of the mainstream news media, and it's why a lot of people are abandoning it in favor of other websites and social media such as Facebook."
This is more wonderful news. With Britain exiting and France poised to reclaim their society and now we have Italy seeing the light. Hopefully the EU dissolves.

Thank you for beaming your comment from way back there in 1998.

Let us know when you reach 2017, where the computer age has long been a part of health care."
Lol you don't think that already happened because of nafta. Manufacturing and auto basically sh&& the bed. You also realize that if nafta was repealed we would revert back to the canada USA free trade agreement of 1989 right. It has never been repealed. Quit thinking it's the end of the world. Nafta shafted us Canadians hard with little benefit to our economy in the long run. Half a million jobs lost from 94-01 alone. Also thanks to nafta chapter 11 we became the most sued  country in free trade. You'd have to basically be brain dead to think nafta in the long run has done us any benefit. Doesn't help when you have poor negotiators here looking out for us taxpayers best interest which is our money. Getting creamed will maybe open some eyes. No gains without pains is investing 101.

As they have chosen to reference fascist atrocities it's appropriate to make some comparisons.  The Monarchist's goal of Kingdom has much in common with a similar group's demand for Lebensraum.  The maniacal focus on blood quantum laws is eerily similar to völkisch, a quest for a racially pure state.
.
The propensity for certain local groups to denigrate as the lying press  those who have a differing view of Hawaiian history has a precursor with another entity which coined the term Lügenpresse.  The local habbit of decrying western influence is identical to  Joesph Goebbels use of Überfremdung to describe Jewish influence on society.  Calling dissident Hawaiians traitors to their people directly correlates with Volksverräter.

Take the Atlantic, where if a team got 3 pts for a win in reg, then Mtl, Ott, Tor, Bos would be a few more pts clear of Fla by virtue of the fact they've won more games in reg.  Your Leafs, heavenly days, would have 90 pts to Fla's 84.

Now, I think it's right that a 5-0 win in reg should count for more than a 2-1 in a SO.  The logic is so apparent when presented that any pushback is nonsensical.  The reply from some regulars here that, hey, them's the rules and rules is rules is so chaotically indefensible that to even post it seems a violation of the most basic of common sense, though that's hardly stopped some before...

Further, rules is changed with dizzying regularity by the NHL nowadays, so let's not have any of that, shall we?

Finally, these same posters have chimed in with such missives as a shot on goal is not the same as a shot on net, and that Your Leafs pass too much in the SO.

And if you talk to Hillary Clinton, she'll say her emails weren't classified.  My point is that people who have an interest in the outcome will pretty much say anything to make sure they make their money, don't get jailed or get elected.  We saw that here on O'ahu with PRP and all the unions saying how great the rail will be for jobs, traffic, etc.  Look at us now with massive looming $10 billion dollar debt and it won't even help our traffic."

"Dear Sir, I understand your argument and for the most part agree that FB and Google should pay taxes. The part I'm unsure of is the claim that the FP pays GST and PST.  The FP is only submitting to the government that which is collected from it's customers. As for EI, and CPP I hope the figures you quote are the company portion of those expenses and don't include the employee portion. The health and education expense is a mystery to me since I'm not aware that any government specifically taxes any company for those two items. If those items are taxes that are charged on your employee benefit plan, again it is your employees that are paying the tax and not the FP. Let's also not forget that for every tax you pay it is deducted as an expense thus reducing your corporate tax. Without providing a link to the ""list"" you refer to, it's difficult to determine whether your statements are entirely correct."

"There are a number of problems that have faced EPD over the past few decades. Some are long term problems such as a police culture whereby some officers see themselves as elite enforcers instead of public servants. They often come from military backgrounds and have conservative and authoritarian political and social views. Many don't even live in Eugene. 
Another problem is poor training which encourages such perspectives and urges the use of force for self-protection even when there is no threat to the officer. 
A powerful police union and poorly-written contracts by administrators make it difficult for the command structure to create any meaningful changes and often lead the city administration to lose cases of arbitration with the rank and file when disciplinary action is taken. 
A new chief will need to be aware of all these issues and still figure out a way to reform the department. It's not an easy task."
"FT:  Yes, it is a complex problem with many factors that are involved and there is no ""magic bullet"" solution but at some point you have to actually do something other than talking about it and hoping to get consensus.

Is it perfect, no, but it does get the ball rolling."
"There can't be Catholic schools in Canada, if we as a society truly believe in equality for women, gays and other religions.  It's not like were talking about the Egalitarian Christian Churches who believe in equality for all, based off well educated modern interpretations of the bible.  Were talking about the Catholic religion which has primitively old discriminatory interpretations, which they refuse to change.  My concern is how these discriminations over time will effect the self esteem and personal views of young Canadians.  The Catholic school funding by our government simply does not belong in this era.  It seems obvious, unfortunately the only way for the funding to stop would involve a large petition and a political agenda. (:"

It is really only a tiny subset of the monotheistic religions that considers it forbidden, a betrayal of their religion to celebrate other religions' holidays. Those people have every right not to do so, but they should stop trying to prevent everyone else from enjoying it.

I celebrated Eid with a family of Muslim friends, and Holi when I was in India, it didn't turn me Muslim or Hindu. Many Muslims from countries that once were moderate and peaceful, nostalgically tell of Muslims and Christians celebrating each others' holidays."

My 17 year old son started suffering from SEVERE acne. We tried EVERYTHING under the sun. I felt so bad for him being in highschool and having acne. I even took him to a dermatologist. I was talking to my sister about it and she told me about Dermalmd blemish serum. She gave him what she had left and within a week you could see a noticeable difference. After 3 weeks his face was cleared up completely and I am AMAZED. He was a little hesitant at first because it is tinted so I asked him to give it a week. He uses it daily and it has definitely changed both of our lives. I hated to see my only son suffer but he isnt anymore. He is the Handsome young man I always saw!

"I like the word "" badly ' because that is how we are doing compared to the US.

Theirs is much better form of democracy than we have in Canada.
They have a powerful , elected and representative Senate plus an elected Congress.

We have neither and even worse we get stuck with Govts that exercise majority control with just 40 % of the votes.

Americans also have unfettered freedom of speech, unlike here in Canada.

American SC Judges are freely selected regardless of States.

Here in Canada, we have 9 SC judges, at least 3 of which must come from Quebec.

And, their executive Branch ( our cabinet )  are selected for  experience and skills, unlike here in canada where they are selected by the PM based on neither of these but merely allocated by sex race and color.


And H, we depend on the US for the defence of our nation"

"North Korea is no longer starving. In fact they are growing at about 2-4% due to economic reforms encouraging small scale capitalism and local markets. That being said its a nightmare of a society. 
Investors are a mixed bag for society in general. Sometimes good, sometimes bad.  What about the big hedge fund speculators ? How do you distinguish ? What's the social value of an investor if the money made is not reinvested into the society that created it?

I've personally witnessed a number of occasions where the airline personnel abused their power and this may be the defining event that forces some action in congress. The CEO needs to come to terms with reality that the actions of his people did a hell of a lot more then ""re-accommodate "" these passengers. We can only hope that this passenger follows the logical path and very publicly sues the stuffing out of United.

(very hard to do as a project for parents on their own free time with no promise we can even get space / funding / licensing etc...when we need a pre-school that works while we are looking!) we would need Federal and / or provincial help down the line anyway, so they may as well help us now and avoid the massive headache and potential disruption of our children's education this is causing"
"Talking points and flag waving nothing else.  Tony Clement said the same things but when asked for ""what exactly would you do differently?"", he didn't ever explain and hung up on the CBC, and the priceless free air time he could have used to sell his plan, (if he really had one in the first place).  

This reflects the same actions as Trumps Executive Order enacting the Muslim Ban. When pressed ""what exactly is the threat, beyond talking points and flag waving?"" and his crack team of US Attorneys had nothing. ""See you in Court!"" was his reaction and he hung up the phone on twitter."

"First of all, the facts: as far as we know at this time, all the disturbed man's firearms were purchased legally and FBI database background checks were done.  Next, regardless of any claims, a legal semi-auto can only fire 1 bullet per trigger pull, so there was no illegal modification to ""fully automatic"".  A person, with a little practice, can fire any gun quicker. Has anyone observed pro-pistol shooting competitions?  Has anyone seen a Wild West re-enactment, where the single-action Colt Peacemaker is ""fanned"" and 6 shots sound like a machine gun?  Next, it is also illegal for a mentally ill person to buy a firearm, the same as it is illegal for someone who uses marijuana or drugs to buy a firearm. Have any of these laws prevented any such mass shootings? A little research show a big NO on that. Laws are to punish the lawbreaker and that seems to be where there is some confusion on the left-leaning. Laws don't prevent crime, otherwise pot smokers would give up or not purchase guns."
"Considering that Obama  sent out 500 drones to kill people extra judicially, failed to close GITMO, initiated  a war in Libya that  had nothing to do with  protecting people and destabilized  an entire region AND covertly funded armed support to rebels in Syria....

Human Rights abuses were atrocious under Bush and Obama but  the media didn't tell us about how their  policies  resulted   in humanitarian crises, failed states and massive refugee flows until well after the fact.

"DD,

A person who is gifted by the Holy Spirit easily recognizes and respects when another is gifted and their experience with God enables them to see quickly when a person is not gifted. Thinking that a person can be gifted by the Holy Spirit without having a testimony about their experience with the power of God is the first evidence that their concepts are based on theory rather than scripture and experience with God. Second is their persistence in arguing with those who are gifted and ministering using the gifts that are in them. Please, get experience with God, discover the gifts He has promised to give all who believe and find the ministry He wants you doing. Then come back and let's celebrate God's greatness together."

It's been one crazy ride but I wouldn't change it for a minute.  My son is now 28, he had his second open heart surgery at 22 (20 years to the day from his first surgery).  
I know that God has allowed this for a reason and I am so thankful that my son is still with us.
You are an awesome mom and please continue to stay strong for your beautiful daughter.

"Cynic11 - the insurance company would most likely never have been privy to their divorce agreement. It would have been up to the ex-wife to hold up her part of the bargain: verbal or on paper.

This was a no-win situation for Trudeau and he chose a politically damaging but arguably the least expensive route to take.  The actual damage was done by the Chretien and Harper govts when they chose the populist, politically safe strategy of bending to the will of the popular opinion even though it violated our own laws.  In other words, they did what was ""popular"", not what was right or even legal and very far from being courageous or principled.      

Stripped down to simple facts:  Khadr is Canadian, like it or not.  And his rights as a Canadian were violated.   So it doesn't matter whether you hate the guy - or what popular opinion about Khadr says.  Our Govt did the right thing, even if it's wrong politically."

"The themes of Hell and Jewish wickedness are also of course found in the Gospels, and may even go back to the historical Jesus. The fateful parable of the wicked tenants (Mk 12:1-12) is the very foundation of supersessionism and is from an older layer of the Synoptic tradition. To what extent does the Spirit allow us to correct the words of Jesus? Did Jesus literally expect the Kingdom to blaze out in glory in a few years (Mk 9:1), so that we are obliged to correct or at least drastically reinterpret his words? Theologically the embarrassment can be solved by distinguishing the limits of his human knowledge from the divine omniscience of the Logos."

"Every time some hikers get lost or hurt and need to be rescued there's the usual complaining about the cost to taxpayers.  But nobody ever whines about all the swimmers, fishermen, boaters and surfers who have to get plucked out of the ocean on a regular basis.  Going out in the water is so dangerous there's even a permanent safety force dedicated to saving those people - the City and County lifeguards.   Yes, some of these hikers are nincompoops who are reckless or clueless.  But there are plenty of other people who do dumb things - like eat too much or drive carelessly - and then have to get government help.   The amount of your tax money spent rescuing hikers is a tiny fraction of the money spent on helping people with health problems due to poor eating habits, for example."

The gig is up, dude. It has nothing to do with RACE and EVERYTHING to do with the reached pricing levels. When all those Americans and, um, Germans (roll eyes) were busy buying en masse just like the Chinese (in your imaginary Southwest BC), they did NOT get houses up to several dozen times the average annual local incomes. This is a WEALTH flood that is up-ending the balance, not a race thing as you desperately pretend.

Thats when Karl Rove and some others made a plan, REDMAP, to attack 25 vulnerable state houses with extreme outside money to take those state houses at any cost so they could get the levers of redistricting. They did in 2010, and redistricted in such a gerrymandered way as had never been seen before using a computer program called Maptitude. 

The lines they made for congressional districts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Florida and North Carolina flipped those states from Democrat congressional majorities to Rep. by a huge ratio. The funny thing was, even though the Dems. took most of the total votes in those states, R's took a much higher ratio of congressmen. This is not democracy."

The fact is I have said nothing different than the kanaka maoil who were arrested outside of the Na'i Aupuni convention, but the difference is, you can not stand hearing it from someone who you assume does not have the magic blood.

"A bit of background on NRG is interesting.  NRG Energy, Inc. was formerly the wholesale arm of Xcel Energy, and was spun off in bankruptcy in 2004.
.
NRG Energy president David Crane resigned as president and CEO in December 2015.  Crane's resignation was a direct response to investor pressure and a declining stock price. The shareholders worried that the independent power producer had invested too many resources into distributed energy, without much to show for it.
.
Governor Ige arbitrarily blocked NextEra's efforts to enter the Hawaiian marketplace. It will be interesting indeed to witness what the agreement with NRG, a financially troubled entity whose owners are focusing on ROI, will means for energy availability and prices Hawaii.
.
While the Governor is busy making aspirational speeches and setting decades hence goals another financially unstable mainland firm is being allowed to assume a major role in his ""renewable energy goal""."

"B. Carfree,

I share your concern with any driver that doesn't obey the laws. I often park on the opposite side of the street to complete my delivery, but I don't drive on the wrong side of the road, don't speed, and am not often distracted. You are correct in that I am a private contractor. This means that I get paid much less than half of what a mail carrier makes, work in the dark, I receive no pension, and I get to pay my car payment, gas, insurance, tires, repairs, bags, and health care.

I put forth extra effort to get my customers their paper during the bad weather. Many in Ms. Newton's neighborhood did not have power or cable for 4-5 days, and they expressed their gratitude for getting their paper. I had to park my car on the few accessible streets, and walk the majority of my route in snow gear. I like to think that I provided great customer service, going ""the extra mile"". By the way, I was able to drive to Ms. Newton's residence.

I appreciate Ms. Newton's compliment.

-attacks ""lefties"" and truth news (DP, WaPo, NY Times etc).
-vocal and repeated pledged allegiance for tRump 
-No compassion or charity or American ideals
-deflect, finger point and blames Obama and Hillary (and Bill) 
-creates false equivalence to normalize immorality
-takes credit where credit is not due (e.g. economy and jobs during 1st year in office) while not taking responsibility for the bad.
- spend money making war instead of taking care of our own
- advocate the dismantling the social safety net, business and environmental regulations protecting us and our quality of life.
- ""pro-life""(what a joke) while also taking away access to birth control and abortion and taking away all social supports for the children born.  They are OK if the children live in abject poverty (over 30% of children in the U.S.) and die of starvation.

"But your argument compares apples to oranges here. Joining the army is not providing a public service. It is a contract that an individual enters into with the government on a one on one basis. CO status allows, in certain instances to recuse yourself from being 'forced' into engaging in that contract in time of war and the draft. Engaging in public commerce and providing a public service, on the other hand, does not allow, contrary to the whole ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone"" signs would have you think, you to not provide service to a group of individuals. That is discrimination - providing service to one group and not another in the public sphere. Question: Why is there not the same uproar and teeth-gnashing about divorce and being ""forced"" to provide services to divorced and remarried (wedding photography, counseling, etc.) people? That, too, is scripturally prohibited. Why does not qualify as a strongly held religious belief in the same way?"

""Well ... this is getting burdensome ... she should know ... she wont get any better ... only makes everyone's life miserable ... it is legal now ... hell ... it is the norm (governed by law) ... why doesn't she just request it ... maybe we can drop a few hints ... like not visiting ...

In some ways all of the above likely are true. After all, some of these officials turned a blind eye to the Afghan detainee abuse scandal and tried to cover it up from public scrutiny.

"I was a student until recently too. It's normal to read 50-100 books a year in many disciplines. When I was expected to read these books, you know where the university made them available? In the library. When they weren't, the professor would order copies fo the library. When I wasn't expected to read them but I wanted to anyway and they weren't in the library, you know what I could do? Order a copy for the library, or loan from another library through ours. I assume many university libraries in the world work the same way. And students are expected to use them that way. 

I also assume that students who value books can't afford - like most of us - everything they want to read. But that then they should be smart enough to figure out they should value their libraries, not undermine them by not using them which is what they are doing. On top of undermining the people who make the books in the first place."

I'm sure you know, if you know anyone with land that contains cattle and/or horses, that baiting or trapping, within legal requirements, to eradicate predators, may be necessary. Hence, where those measures are most likely in use. Of course, if it's coyotes, they probably shoot them.

Historic tide levels (highs and lows) and maximum current speeds (ebbs and floods) are also available for specific areas, such as where this net-pen is placed off of Cypress Island. I suggest that the people promoting salmon net-pens at DFW and Cooke Aquaculture spend more time (like most Northwest-based crabbers, recreational and commercial fishermen, and recreational boaters do) researching the predictable tide/current conditions before placing net-pens. I wonder if the proposed salmon net-pen site outside of Port Angeles has been researched as well as the Cypress Island site was?"

When that happened all the southern Democrats left the Democrat Party and joined the Republican Party where the racists have resided since.

"Stunning story. 

My heartfelt sympathy is extended to husband, Larry Kelly.

Entrepreneurs often reap the greatest rewards when they weld themselves to their enterprises...heart and soul (and bear at least part of the responsibility of the resulting broken marriages.)  I speak from experience. So, I  groaned aloud reading this sad tale. 

So, what are the lessons here we can learn about business, the people who run them, the people who rely on them for their own incomes?

""But now that I see the books and now when I look back at financial statements, I realized, holy cow...""  That's one. Sharing and clarity--and concern when neither are present. 

""...many journalists and designers...were owed thousands of dollars for work completed years earlier, and had been relying on the payments to pay bills of their own.""  That's another.  Freelancers & contract workers, in ALL sectors: take care of yourselves! Don't wait; take action. Visit in person and DEMAND payment--be the squeakiest wheel."

"If you can tell me what Canadian culture is other than an amalgam of what has developed over 150 years, then your argument might hold water.  I also take issue with your notion of adapt to Canada.  Does that mean giving up ones religion?  If so, tell it to the Jews, the Hindus, the Sikhs as well.  Maybe the Catholics too, at least outside Quebec perhaps?  Perhaps lets stop St. Paddy's Day celebrations as foreign culture, maybe even a barbaric practice."
"Anyone walking the streets downtown at 4:30 am carrying a gun, unless in APD uniform is absolutely looking to do harm one way or another.  At work, we see these officers every single day come into our cleaners and we see the type of people they have to deal with regularly.  I'm sure it's not an easy job to do and our police officers are human beings also that feel fear and panic just like everyone else.  I pray for a full recovery for the injured officer and want him and all of APD to know that I appreciate them and the possible and unfortunate sacrifices that they make to ensure our safety.  And for the lost souls walking around downtown up to no good, I wish you would think twice before making such horrible decisions.  But I will pray for you too."
"Pride rears its head in various ways; one glaring way is not listening (in this case reading with a sincere and open heart) to the actual words given in a response.  

I did note for instance that the focus on virtues isn't necessarily a ""Catholic Church"" thing, and I also mentioned that the Cardinal could use his influence to suggest the implementation of a solid virtues program (not the one where people superficially say ""I value you"" as they sing Kumbaya) in the PUBLIC schools of Chicago.

Pride is of course a vice, and it is countered with cheerful and near constant acts of humility, until it gets put back where it belongs. 

A good spiritual director can listen to someone's use of language, and how they interact and help people to tame various evidences of pride, or vanity, and over love of comfort. 

Takes work.

This is the sort of work that is done in a real virtues program.   

Pride creates a lot of anger, and other unconstructive responses.  Can really damage relationships."
"Trudeau is still the Liberal Party leader, despite the attacks (still continuing) which started in 2013.    That's the relevance.

Trudeau was not even in politics in 2006.   In fact, that was 3 Liberal Party leaders ago.     That's the irrelevance.   And I stand by my statement that it was kept alive by the CPC's faux outrage.    It ran on a Quebec party website for a couple days at most before being pulled.    Yet the CPC use that one example as their excuse du jour whenever they are called out on their never-ending smear tactics.       You pretty much demonstrate this.     Oh, and find your anecdote about your ""card carrying Liberal friends"" very sketchy and convenient.     Whenever somebody mentions their ""card carrying friends"" - you can pretty much discount the anecdote.

Despite warnings to Oregon,s mostly liberal elected leaders and their pet judges this bunch treated pers as a pot of gold that was going to solve all budget worries. Your union bashing is misplaced unions didn't do pers to you, Pers put a smile on county contract negotiators faces and a spring in their steps when we told them it's approved.

"""This is the difference between a guy ascending toward excellence in Wentz and one that is mediocre at best in Siemian. One put his team on his back and the other did nothing.""

Bingo...you win the prize! This is what several posters have been trying to tell you for a bit now. Trevor Siemian is an average NFL QB who will only be as good as the team around him. If the line protects and the running game is clicking then it is Siemian who can throw 4 TD passes (see the Cowboys game). Carson Wentz to the delight of Eagles fans is growing into what he was expected to be as the 2nd over-all pick in the draft. A franchise QB who is the main man on the team. The kind of player that can throw his team on his back. This is what Paxton Lynch was drafted to be....this is what Brock Osweiller was drafted to be. Trevor Siemian was a 7th rounder...Chad Kelly was Mr Irrelevent. They are the type of guys you are going to have to help.

"Maybe.  He claims to be able to cut spending in some areas, but is talking about large investments in health care, education, and infrastructure.  He also wants to give young people a ""culture pass"" of close to a thousand dollars so they can attend the theatre and concerts.  He has no plans to thwart immigration, and has stated that no religion is a problem for France (admittedly, this isn't economic, but it's a far cry from the far right, and distances himself from Trump as well).

On the other hand, he is upping military spending, hiring more cops, and creating more prison beds, all generally hallmarks of the right.

The only evidence I see of trump making America great again is by condoning ( not condemning)  racist,  bigoted people and reviving the slave and Massa mentality.  Perfect example of this is how trump( massa)  is selling off anything this country has or have accomplished and betraying the american people their ethics,  morals and real family values(the analogy of american people being pawns and slaves)  to the highest country bidding."

I know someone Jewish who thinks all this PC stuff is way out of hand and is not the least it offended if someone wishes him Merry Christmas.  He will probably observe the day by going to a movie and Chinese food anyway, and is more concerned over an Islamic terror attack than being wished a Merry Christmas by a well-meaning person. I think this is keeping things in proper perspective. 

In the United States, Christmas is a public holiday and people get the day off. Some people observe the secular aspect without any religious undertones. This is all a very first world problem."

"Good proposal!  Price seats more accurately according to demand and the profit margins are squeezed for brokers.  Unfortunately, this works well on paper but not in real time.  Raising prices means that some fans are not going to be able to afford tickets, a problem most artists don't like seeing.  Dynamic pricing has been tried for some sports tickets, where prices rise/ fall with the teams performance (and demand.)  Inevitably, you will find fans who pay $100 and will be ticked when they find the fan next to them paid $40.  Works great with hotels and airline tickets.  Not so much with concert tickets.  Something that you are seeing more of with Ticketmaster:  VIP seats.  An allocation (but not all of them) of some of the best seats are often priced with a premium and closer to the true value of that seat.  Its harder for a broker to squeeze the profit out of a $1500 front row seat than an identical seat priced at $100.  Hit up my startup and get presale passwords: roostr.com"

Is this anything like the planning and spending that the Eugene City Council has been using on their Taj City Hall?   

Seems similar to me."
"I have a close relative who has been part of fishing industry and his first question was why so many people on a longliner? 
A pole and line boat (Aku) boat yes but a longliner? 20 crew for a 79' vessel? Groceries alone would consume way to much space ( even if it is just rice, onions and by catch) 
The whole foriegn crew issue is bogus and invisible corporate welfare that punishes US workers by allowing underpaid, abuse, workers to undercut US workers who would never become whistle blowers on violations of environmental, regulatory, reporting crimes.
Before some one fakes a concern about what obeying the law and hiring workers to US standards would do to the price of fish remember these vessels get whatever the market will bear and any surplus is just pocketed by corporation. So any savings is never seen by consumer it is just cream skimmed off the top."

If that is the case, marriages witnessed by SSPX priests (or even those witnessed by anyone else) are all valid, though the ones without RCC priests may not be canonically licit.  As for the Sacrament of Reconciliation, it is God Who extends pardon, not the priest.  God forgives us as soon as we sincerely ask for pardon - no witness is required.  We go to confession not to receive forgiveness but to show solidarity with the Body of Christ and to acknowledge the damage we have done to the People of God."

"Only a few countries such as Russia and the US really ever cracked the technology for making “unitary” Sarin that had any kind of useful shelf-life. The main chemical reaction that produces Sarin creates 1 molecule of hydrogen fluoride, a potent and dangerous acid, for every molecule of Sarin. This residual HF destroys nearly anything the Sarin is stored in, and quickly degrades the agent.  The US and the former USSR made a huge effort to find a way out of this problem.  They found different ways to refine the HF out of the Sarin using very expensive chemical engineering techniques. 

Furthermore, The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspections after Syria’s accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2013 revealed a variety of fixed and mobile mixing apparatus for making binary nerve agents.. Syria either did not develop such techniques or decided it was far cheaper, safer, and easier to stockpile binary components for a “mix it as you need it” process."

But it's not just art criticism that uses such obfuscatory bafflegab.  'Cultural studies' of various kinds is equally drivellous (e.g. 'interrogating the heterogeneity of racialized archetypes').

I once had a professor who taught me one of the most valuables lessons in university.  It was in sociology and he assigned a reading full of that kind of stuff and when class time came he asked numerous people to talk about what they understood from it.  Several responded with various efforts to elucidate it until one student admitted he didn't understand it he even said it didn't make sense.  
""Eactly!"" the prof shouted.  ""It doesn't say anything!  Just because it's in a book doesn't make it good.  Trust your own minds.  If it seems like nonsense, there's a good chance it IS nonsense."""

"Hello Owl,

I see, so you are in favour of having Canadian laws being such that for any non-Inuit writer here who wants to write a novel about the Inuit, the writer must first pay two million dollars, the ""asking price"", to an Inuit literary group, and for a non-Japanese poet here who wants to write a Haiku, the law you favour would require that the poet first pay two million dollars, the ""asking price"", to a Japanese Canadian literary group. 

Thank you for clarifying, in the laws you favour, your preference for the term ""asking price"" rather than the phrase ""being forced to pay"".

Look, regardless what words you prefer to name the money requirement in question, I am opposed to the situation you embrace."
Good on the Supreme Court and down with Stowers. Teens don't choose to avoid talking to their parents about these problems unless they don't feel safe doing so. Respect that.
"Him being acquitted doesn't automatically make the complaint false, as anyone with a shred of common sense will acknowledge. Unless she clearly perjured herself there is no basis for legal action against her. Going down that road would be a severe disincentive to report sexual assaults and absolutely not in the public interest.  
There may be a reasonable middle ground but I don't think it's been discovered yet. I know of one case in Alberta where the complainants did make false accusations and perjure themselves, to harm a teacher they disliked. The case obviously collapsed after years of legal process and wrecked the latter stage of his career - no repercussions to the complainants for an obviously criminal act.  In that case the crown should have acted but they played the false complaint out all the way to trial and embarrassed themselves.
Your notion of going after some accusers may be valid in a few cases but I don't think our system is smart enough to get it right."
"Why are most articles today have the writer always demanding that people think or act in a certain way.

""... Republican president who left office in disgrace ...""  Mr. Nixon overstepped the bounds of propriety in office and for that was properly hammered by Congress.  He also had his genuine accomplishments, as others note on these boards.

"What strikes me as most significant is that water drawn from the ""high-level aquifer"" is already brackish and approaching the point of not being drinkable.  That most likely indicates that the Ghyben-Herzberg freshwater lens under Lanai is relatively small and thin -- probably an ongoing natural condition (since Lanai sits somewhat in Maui's ""rain shadow"") and partly due to historic long-term depletion for agriculture.

It's an obvious fact of nature that one can't continue drawing more fresh water from this lens than it receives from natural ""recharging"" processes, without depleting it.  Excess withdrawal causes the ""mixing zone"" of brackish water to rise upward, and eventually freshwater wells start turning brackish.  

That the high-level aquifer water is brackish is great cause for concern -- and fiddling with the definition of ""potable"" so it can continue to be used for golf course irrigation is turning a blind eye to the problem and will only make it worse and more intractable."

"NO it's not the only thing we can do.  Instead of focusing on long range commuters, the focus should be more local.  Leave light rail and express buses for people to commute downtown and to the tech center.

Focus on biking, bus, walking and metro shuttles for getting around downtown.  It's too wasteful for each suburban commuter to drive themselves in their own car alone to work.  You also have to build the alternative infrastructure first to get people to use it.  It's like field of dreams, if you build it they will come.

Development and planing should also focus on using existing light rail infrastructure.  

To say all the front can do is add more lanes for cars is ignorant.  Read any credible traffic study and they all agree that traffic will always fill up the number of highway and street lanes to capacity.  That's what LA and Houston did and now they are massive sprawling metropolises.   You have to make it easy for people to get around without their only option being to drive."
"Very sad story for the family.  Our government, particularly the party of 'law & order' and the military brass should hang there heads in shame.  As for the rest of us, civilian and service personnel alike, here is the lesson.  

Our government and military requires that our soldiers have blind patriotism and the belief that whether 'my country right or wrong' I will do my duty.  This thinking amounts to having blind faith in the decisions of politicians.  This mindset should be unacceptable in our 21st century society.  The politicians and the military that expect other Canadians to risk their lives are VERY political.  Canadians should be more political, particularly when  asked to support a war.  Thomas Welch should not have been in Afghanistan because our government should not have sent him there in the first place.

I appreciate that my thoughts on the subject are controversial particularly for families that paid the greatest price & who continue to search for a valid reason."
"This is very troubling. I saw the television interview referenced in the news report above. The fact that Trump didn't disavow the KKK or David Duke, the former leader of the KKK, in unequivocal terms, as a major American political party's presidential candidate, should be concerning not only to the party's voters but to all Americans. This incident was made even worse when a separate news report detailed that Trump, indeed, had previously known about David Duke when Trump considered running as a Reform Party candidate, and David Duke was also a candidate in that party. And just yesterday, one of Trump's many tweets got him in more trouble when he re-tweeted a quote from Mussolini, the former fascist dictator of Italy during WWII. When Trump was asked by Chuck Todd of NBC News about why he would use a quote from Mussolini, Trump replied it didn't matter who said it because he liked the quote, that it was a good quote."

"Some fruit and particularly some vegetables just don't taste good to children.  As they get older some of these fruits and vegetables actually start to taste good to them.  I know this because my son had to have a ""no thank-you"" helping (one small taste) of everything that was served.  He has told me often how glad he is that we did the ""no thank-you"" helpings because a lot of the foods he didn't like early on, he now really likes.  For years when he was a child, he would only eat the vegetable corn.  Now he has a wide variety that he enjoys.  Same with fruit.  I think the key is to not force children to eat things that just don't taste good to them.  The ""no thank-you"" helping is very, very small and pretty painless so the child doesn't feel the need to rebel against it."
"I am 68-years old.  I use my private group health insurance to provide for my needed health care.  Although I paid into Medicare for much of my adult life, it does not provide for ambulatory care nor medicines.  The polices that are available to provide such coverage cost more than my current plan and have deductibles, which mine does not.  I would oppose putting the rest of the country on a system that has to be subsidized by private coverage after all is said and done.  Even if you changed the system to provide needed care, the administrative cost per patient to provide Medicare is $509.  The cost to provide coverage under private plans is $453 per person.  Where are the savings?  After 35-years in health care management and public affairs, 30-with the Federal government, I know that most people are doing their best, in public and private systems.  Why turn an entire industry on its head for philosophical reasons?  Universal access to care is possible with a public/private system."

"I think there is a bit of revisionism in this editorial.  It stresses slavery as the cause of the civil war.  It was a factor, but so were states rights.  The South was not the first area of the United States to consider secession.  During the war of 1812 areas of New England talked about leaving the Union because they disagreed with the war with England at a time that England was fighting Napoleon.  It is worthy of note that Abraham Lincoln wrote a New York newspaper in 1862 and said "" My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery."""

"It will be interesting to see what Sheehan and Civil Beat do when the spotlight dims.  The issues raised in her letter are largely not personal to Louis Kealoha.  If the concern is about systemic change, her letter should be re-issued as a request/demand to the Commission to investigate each of the issues.  Sheehan can put it on the agenda and make her case publicly.
      
        If the Commission declines, Sheehan is capable - as is Levinson - of a detailed written explanation of the issues she raised in the letter.   Extensive public records are available on many of them such as the discrimination case.  

        These issues have been raised before the Commission and reported on by CB but only in a perfunctory way shaped as attacks on Kealoha.

It is absolutely stunning that Toronto voters accept any of this. But ignorance and complacency are the standard in Toronto.

Meanwhile, in London Ontario, the home of Debbie 'Deadwood' Matthews, is watching the party spread as many dollars as possible to ensure her re-election.

"It is not the fact that priests have been excommunicated lately, it is the fact that the threat of excommunication is still there today. The orders that Pope Pius XI issued back in 1922 remain in enforce today. I believe I read somewhere that some Bishop threatened Tom Doyle with excommunication because of his work on behalf of victims. In typical Tom Doyle fashion he said bring it on. He knew more about Cannon law than almost any Bishop. There have been more priests coming forward lately to report their fellow priests. That is very late in coming but certainly a welcome sign. I do believe that if you polled Catholic priests, the vast majority would hold Cannon Law supersedes civil law. That needs to change. If Francis truly believes in justice for victims, he needs to overturn what Pius XI put into effect in 1922."
Now that's what I call an inconvenient truth.

Bautista is dancing with .100 again, and has struck out 10 times in 25 ABs, with three paltry hits and a single RBI.

Russ Martin is still oh-for-the-season, now 0 for 18.

What's with this Pearce guy, supposedly rated to play every day while Smoak and Carrera platoon as part-timers. Since he's only once played 100 games once since arriving in 2007, he was hailed as an off-season versatile guy, yet has posted a .158 average, while the other two guys are both a hundred points or more higher. Ben Zobrist he is not.

"Sure, the rule of force is a law of nature, but not the only one. Finding and preserving an ecological niche in which to flourish is more the rule than force. Also, other species don't colonize an area, cut down all the trees, slaughter the indigenous animalia into extinction, pollute streams and lakes and the air itself, overpopulate it to the point of exhausting available resources, and then justify the omnicide in the name of ""progress"".  

Civilized humans have always figured human ""difference"" from the rest of nature in terms of self-knowledge, however. And this difference has been trumpeted by civilized humans as a basis for religion, science, commerce, technology economics . . .    What you're saying is that Europeans can be forgiven for the genocide of the First Nations because they were only acting naturally. 

That's a radical idea--perhaps the most radical idea imaginable--albeit perhaps a bit too convenient given the history since Columbus."
"A bit (?) of an omission in this article is any mention of the travails of Post Media. This is a great (i .e. bad) example of a leveraged buyout that makes money for the hedge fund while destroying the company. Should there be laws to ban this type of dysfunctional behavour or does business have a license to do whatever?

The crisis is in small communities without a local paper. There is no viable solution via government subsidy. It is not a solution to create a government subsidized news media monopoly in a local market.

Fake news is another problem. It has always existed; partisans 'know' evil when they see it! We have to have faith that people will eventually understand the false equivalency of science = hoax. Perhaps the comments on this article will provide some hope that this is possible! ; )"

Every time a mass killing occurs we get the anti gun nuts spewing venom about guns.  But you see how easy it is to kill.  Just driving a truck on a sidewalk takes out 80.  All we need is the media to tell everyone about the idea and then presto American mass killers will start driving cars and trucks into crowds.

"That's certainly a base way of looking at it however humans have generally, present company excepted perhaps, evolved beyond such base imperatives which is why we are now the dominant species.

"Except that this is a disingenuous comparison, and is a one-sided conflict.

This only continues because the Israeli government fundamentally rejects Palestinian rights and statehood, and has made a conscious choice to perpetuate a military, political, and economic campaign to deny them these things. And the world has done nothing to hold it accountable for its decades-old brazen defiance of the UNSC and systemic violation of the very laws intended to prevent such an injustice."
"Go to many Habs games then? Thanks for the info, I wasn't too confident that there wasn't government investment in Bombadier considering the new tendency for bail outs. But that $1 billion can get you 10% of a company with $16 billion in revenue shows that Bombadier must be sick. It's overheads must be huge,

I still stand by the crux of my argument. It's the responsibility of the government and citizens of the country where the crime is committed to demand justice. Not the country where a person or company is domiciled.

"Over the last few weeks, until very recently, both the press and the many commenters on this forum have really been piling on Gonzales, Story, and Desmond, proclaiming that WHEN the Rockies do not make the playoffs, those guys will be the reason. Funny how baseball works—""that's baseball""—in that now that they are a whisker away, these guys' ascendence is the very thing that is propelling their team forward. So, while Black's handling of the pitchers has been awesome, his patience with these guys may, at the end of the day, be the difference-maker.

All it will take now to get into at least a play-in is:

Rockies go 0-3, Brewers must finish 3-1 in their last 4 games, 3 of which are against the Cardinals.

Rockies go 1-2, Brewers must finish 4-0.

Rockies go 2-1, they are in without a play-in.

Note: For the Cardinals to get in it will take a miracle. But if they come close, the Brewers are out.

If the Rockies go deep into the playoffs, I would hope that Black would get it...."

"Excuse me? There is no moral equivalency here, Richard. When you make one all you are doing is supporting Nazism, full stop. ""Both sides"" are not wrong when one side consists of swastika wearing, ""Heil Trump"" shouting, goose stepping honest to god actual Nazis. Why is it so hard for you guys to condemn this? Republicans used to be against fascism and Nazism, but in the age of Trump I guess they're somehow considered an acceptable faction of the conservative movement. How are you not ashamed of this?
Stop misusing the term ""free speech."" No one was arrested for saying or printing anything, therefore there was no infringement of free speech. Free speech means the government cannot impose jail time, fines or other legal penalties for engaging in protected expression.

"One of the most worrisome aspects of this decision is that when you read Trump's speech and his alleged justifications for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement it's clear he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. As with so much of what he says, the speech is filled with multiple statements that are blatantly false.  You can't help but worry that if he is this misinformed about something as basic as climate science, then what kind of critical analysis will he use on more complicated problems?

A couple more years of decisions like this and we better all start learning Chinese. If our country refuses to look toward the future, the Chinese have shown that they are very eager to become the world economic leader in low carbon technologies."

Unfortunately, our bums, emboldened by the friends of homelessness, can't be bothered to carry their rubbish to our plentiful garbage cans and they often aren't even toilet trained. 

As someone who has picked up and disposed of more trash from homeless people than I have generated myself (by a factor of over five), I'm fresh out of sympathy for these parasites. Every ne camp that is sanctioned brings us ever more theft, ever more trash in our public space and ever more human feces in our parks, streets and yards. Time to bring back chain gangs."

"What a nightmare for those of us born c. late 40's to late 50's ... black or white (the two colours cited being more or less valid at the time of the generation's formative years - whereas more flavours, again generally speaking, are around now).  All we believed in, some of us fought for ... trashed in favour of a new form of racism.  I'm glad my black friend/mentor, who grew up black in Chicago in the 40/50's, is not around to see how his adopted country of Canada/Ontario turned out.  He would be horrified, as we both were as we watched this develop.  This will not have a happy ending for anyone, despite all the squishy good intentions."
"The aftermath certainly has been. If you think that most Americans love living in chronically uncertain times because there's an incompetent, ignorant, unpredictable, lying, spoiled nut-job man-child at the helm, better think again.  Because of the nutter for whom you voted, we're on the verge of nuclear war with his Korean counterpart. Our allies have to hold their collective noses in Trump's presence in order to be able to stomach him; our enemies hate us more than ever and the rest of the world rightly thinks we're complete idiots.  Health care for millions is threatened, social security & Medicare are threatened, our educational system is threatened; our very way of life is threatened by the nihilist installed by his equally deluded Chicken Little freaks. If you think people are enjoying the 24/7 anxiety caused by the nutter in the White House, you're sadly mistaken."

Canada's growth is due to excessive consumer spending due to low interest rates. Any economist will tell you that this is not good. Consumer debt is at record levels and any slight increase in the interest rate will bring down the economy like a sack of rocks. The rest of the economy not dependent on consumer debt is due to the US.

That word also alarmed me.

"Will Trump's claim that his plan will include  ""insurance for everybody,"" join Obama's assertion that ""If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor"", and Sarah Palin's ""death panels"" on the list of health insurance hyperbole?

Republicans been unable to put together a plan (despite saying they were going to replace the ACA for the past 8 years), and now GOP politico's are anxious about the political fallout from ending coverage  It gets worse, WA Democrats Cantwell and Murray voted against giving Americans access to cheaper Canadian pharmaceuticals which won't help  keep down medical costs. Now ACA covers more of our citizens, kept pre-existing conditions from disqualifying people from insurance coverage, and covered adult children to age 26 on their parent's insurance. Most Americans don't want these provisions to end.

"This has been a long-term trend that started with the baby boomers. Failure to implement meaningful structural reform in entitlements, climate change mitigation, and infrastructure investment have left our government with a looming massive debt. The baby-boomers never created the productivity gains that were needed to head-off those long-term investment failures, and instead took short-term gains. Hickenlooper is at least demonstrating compassion. What we really need to do is cull baby-boomers from the government administration and make smarter investment decisions. 50 years of a do-nothing economic generation needs to be stopped."

"Once again, note that the Trump defenders are behaving more like fans than supporters - fans follow blindly; supporters view with a critical eye. He is turning the presidency into a mockery; I can only hope that it's a short period of time before his colleagues tell him to either grow up, stop blaming, and lead or he should resign and head back to tv."
"I absolutely agree we as a Church should address the issue of racism in this country, in my native country, and everywhere else. I'm not sure what role removing statues should have in that process, because the racism obviously runs deeper. In some cases, removing statues may do nothing more than create an illusion. In my opinion, if the removal of statues is not accompanied by a systemic effort to uproot racist ideas and attitudes, we won't have accomplished anything. So perhaps the removals should come at the end of a process, as a sort of culmination of a national effort to excise a cancer, and their presence till then should serve as a reminder of what remains to be done.
Will our bishops take the lead in bringing an end to racism? They could....but I too have some dubias."
Oh I agree the current batch of legislators are a majority of Republicans but It's been going on more like forty years. Every since the common Alaskan no longer had any skin in the game its been a spend fest by both parties.
"That's fine, you can roll your eyes and defend micreations of justice all you please, but there is a price tag. They say ""injustice begets war, and war begets injustice."" They're right, you know.

I'll tear this corrupted evil system of justice down one brick at a time, one step at a time, one day at a time, as long as God-given faculties enable (hopefully another two or three decades at least) until I find myself standing in a free field surrounded by bricks. Then, and only then, we may build a credible good system for ourselves in this wayward failed place.  

Together, we can demonstrate to Colorado justice why injustice never pays, why they must operate with perfection and above all error, and why, when they do err, they must correct. Because life under injustice isn't life at all, it certainly isn't freedom.

"A well reasoned piece, Pierre, but surely the PP now has an obligation to explain her actions to the country.
She needs to explain how and why she made such a serious and basic error, and no-one in her huge team of lawyers at the office of the PP picked up the error, or *cough* ""typo""!


She also needs to confirm or deny that she was acting on the orders or suggestions of others - if she were to confirm it, she would have to resign immediately, and if she denies it, she would have to be removed from office IF it was later proven and found that she was indeed acting on someone else's instructions.

She is due to release the now completed report on the Estina / Vrede dairy farm fiasco (apparently used to fund the Gupta's oh so tacky Sun City wedding) - let's see how THAT goes.
Given the revelations of the Gupta leaks, anything less than an absolute lambasting of the Guptas and  Minister Zwane and calls for prosecution of the perpetrators, and we will know for sure that she is captured."

"Well, to dip a toe in the waters of 'that horse has left the barn' I'll just point out that Trump, by several accounts, is not taking the daily National Security briefing , and that there has been little to zero communication with State on matters like communicating with leaders of other countries. If you are sticking with ""nothing that I regard as significant or noteworthy has occurred during the transition period to date"" then I must suggest that you either a) don't really give a crap about this stuff, or b) that you have not been paying attention-respectfully submitted.

Examples include bills to address the heroin/opioid epidemic, repeal No Child Left Behind, a long-term highway bill to give certainty to transportation infrastructure projects (and jobs), an FAA bill, a veteran suicide prevention bill, a permanent fix of the Medicare doctor reimbursement formula, an overhaul of the Toxic Substances Control Act to let EPA regulate more dangerous products like asbestos, made it harder for potential terrorists to get visas, and a lot more that you can find at https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/#bystatus.

"I have and like cars but enjoyed the article. It was mentioned how much time the average car spends being parked. There is a clear opportunity here for disruption by figuring out the insurance issue and allowing owners of cars to rent theirs out, like Air BnB. I think I read about something along this line. Clearly the big hurtle is how to address liability, repairs and the like. I strongly doubt that a car insurance company would be amused if their insureds were renting out their vehicles. But for every problem there is a solution and perhaps a price to be paid. Many of us would likely gladly 'lend' our cars more often, if we felt that we were covered in terms of liability, and a fair amount paid to cover overhead and opportunity."

"Since 2008 financial crisis China has gone on a credit frenzy and created more credit than the value of the entire US banking system and we're talking several trillions $$. That money was spent on ghost cities, bridges to nowhere and many many other useless lavish projects that will never make any return on the investment,  making many Chinese enormously rich very fast at the same fast. As a result of that China has become a Ponzi scheme, so the Red Barrons in Beijing cannot afford any trade war with anybody, because it will collapse their fragile system and make poor masses very angry.

January 20, 2009 Republican leaders in congress literally plotted to sabotage and undermine the U.S. economy during President Obama's inauguration. 12 republican senators, Frank Luntz and Newt Gingrich plotted to destroy America's Economy.

But the voucher supporters know that's an easier sell than ""We want to send our kids to a ritzy school that we can't afford on our own, so we want the taxpayers to help out.""
The rich don't need vouchers but will gladly take the vouchers if they're being handed out.
The middle class with aspirations would use vouchers and their own money to go to the primo schools, the ones with cachet.
The poor would be sending their kids to any school that would be willing to accept vouchers as full and complete payment. That would be the public schools and maybe a few private ones.
And to all the middle-class supporters of vouchers? The whole point of primo schools is that they are exclusive. Inviting in everyone is the opposite of exclusive. They'll raise their rates beyond what you can afford with the vouchers and remain exclusive."

"The GET tax is an excellent way to fund rail construction. People just do not feel the extra tax. In fact a number of economists favor a similar value added tax, or VAT, to replace the income tax at the federal level.

And we really should be taxing vacation rentals. Everyone should pay their fair share.

Corruption IIRC has a bigger effect on nonpayment of taxes. Corruption is so bad in India that the govt recently failed to stop tax dodgers who use cash in all transactions to hide their income. The govt tried to recover taxes by issuing new currency. But corruption allowed the wealthy to game the system.

China just executes anyone that they find corrupt and Xi Jing Ping has followed the money to the top most levels of govt. I hope he is successful and succeeds in bringing the Chinese economy into the 21st Century.

"On what grounds do you say that Trump's policy wasn't based on evidence?

The evidence* is that providing transgender surgery and hormones would cost the US military between $2.4 million and $8.4 million per year, in addition to the time lost. That's to cover the estimated 29-129 service members who would seek the treatment yearly. It's rational to ask, is that additional cost worth the small number of soldiers gained from it? While that matter is being studied it's reasonable to put a hold on transgender people joining the US military. And that's what Trump did. 

It's also reasonable to assume that, as did 18 other countries including Canada, the US military will conclude that allowing transgendered people to serve does not seriously impact the force's ability to function.

"An often overlooked culprit in all of this is the licensed medical provider who wrote the prescription which is required for OxyContin. Regardless if these providers where subject to ""relentless visits"" by Purdue representatives, it was their pen that wrote that script. There are multiple drug reference handbooks that are industry standard that described the full effects and side effects of all current pharmacy medications. For any medical provider with the license to write prescriptions to claim they were unaware is grounds for malpractice. It is standard procedure to reference the medication including unique patient history.
I have 25+yrs in rural Alaska as a Advanced EMT and 12 of those as a Lead Flight medic. We saw a huge increase of OxyContin referenced in patient records during this period for pain that likely could have been managed well with physical therapy and over the counter Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen within dose.
Go after Purdue, but many providers are equally guilty."

It is not entirely clear to me what he is looking out for, there, but it seems to have a lot more to do with personal legacy interests, with personal philosophy interests, with an agenda more in tune with one activist arm of the Liberal Party rather than with the actual fabric of Canada, and maybe something to do as well with getting nods of approval from certain wanted crowds and organizations that have nothing to do with Main Street Canada...."

"Jacking up minimum wages is just window dressing for politicians. 

Ontario is not cranking out decent private sector jobs and that's because it's not seen as a good place for tech, manufacturing and R&D to plant their roots. The job market for individuals, allowing them a pool of private sector possibilities to better their pay by moving on, barely exists anymore. So if they get into government directly, or into an area that floats on government funding, they stay for life.

Manufacturers and processors are leaving, or not coming to Ontario because of the high costs (especially hydro) and the uncertainty about  the Liberals next self-bailout.

Even if he was able to restore the manufacturing capacity of the US, as it was in the 50s and 60's, he would be faced with a generational deficit of unbelievable proportions, i.e. total debt and obligations in excess of 250 Trillion dollars. It was their politicians who stole the money and left the country bankrupt in the false belief that they would always have growth, and now, many of the same people who have been gaming the system for years are back in control (i.e. Goldman Sachs etc).

There is no reason why democrats should be anti-gun. We drove many middle America democrats out of the party to become Reagan Republicans and vote against their own self-interest, in part, because our Vietnam protest and reaction to political assassinations of the 60's. led to an unstoppable zeal to recreate the party into a rainbow coalition. We became pacifists who hired out our war-making to professionalized military of the poor and people of color. We live in cities  where we depend on police to provide the illusion of security and we are shocked, shocked! when violence shatters the delusion.  And of course we feel entitled to legislate against everything we don't like.  Why can't we take responsibility for our own security?"

"God's first instruction to the male and female was, ""Be fertile and multiply."" (Gn.1:27,28). God settled the man in the garden to care and cultivate it with a suitable partner. (Gn. 2:15, 18) The man and his wife were naked, yet they felt no shame. (Gn. 2:25) This was God's invitation to discover the miracle and mystery of human sexuality.
God said, ""I will place my law within them, and write it upon their hearts."" (Jer. 31:33) When we look at others according to the law written in our hearts, we see with the eyes of love. When selfish lust clouds our thoughts and actions, we deny God, sinning not only against a divine image of God but also against our own self.
Human sexuality is not sinful. It is willful sexual abuse that goes against the law God has written in our hearts, whether that abuse is heterosexual, homosexual or self abuse. Our task is to teach our children about human sexuality according to the law God has written in our hearts.

There are bakers everywhere.  Why do couples select certain ones over others?  He is claiming to be an artist which allows him to choose who he makes his artistic creations for.

"we have seen the dead salmon floating down the river. That was due to a low flow and the river baked in the heat. That's with the dam holding back reserves. Take the dam out and that's going to happen every other year. As for replacing bulbs, done that. These bulbs do not remotely last as long as they claim and are like low flow toilets. You flush 5 times wasting water. Now I throw away 3 light bulbs replacing 1. Like low flow toilets, will be another 20 years before they have this down. The reality is these dams are at the end of their life and need replaced. This isn't about hydro power, it's about reservoirs holding back water for irrigation, and to keep the flow up on the river in late summer months. They need to rebuild the dam, regardless of hydro and put a fish ladder in. Restoring this river to the wild will backfire. It was overfishing salmon that did them in. Not dams."

"Wow, I didn't realize the stats on paying back HBP. My husband & I have used the HBP and lifelong learning plan (LLP) and both worked for us. We purposely maxed out RSP's a few years in advance of using both programs, using our line of credit to do so; and the paid off the line of credit in full when we received our tax refund (we did last minute contributions at the deadline and then filed our taxes  early so that we wouldn't have to pay interest). A few years later we pulled out the RSP's via the HBP (we took a risk and invested them in stock and a dividend ETF, and both did well) for our down payment. I did the same for  the LLP So I could get a master's degree. The result was that our house greatly appreciated in price, I received a few promotions due to the degree that tripled my salary, and we gladly pay more than the minimums each year to pay back the LLP/HBP. I have a DB pension (no, I'm not a govt worker) so I don't have much RSP room anyway. Obviously this may not work..."

"If there are more people registered to vote than PFD recipients, there are obviously too many people ineligible to vote on the voter rolls, which would explain the low turnouts (which are percentages of the total number of registered voters).

Now, if Ballot Measure 1 included a better way to purge the voter rolls and keep them current, I would vote for it."

"The central issue here is whether or not the fundraisers are ""preferential"". They are not. Anyone can attend, no one is excluded. Just like with any CPC or NDP fundraiser.

Marriage to us was a commitment. 
We are both physically attracted to each other. She has physical features that I cherish and she admires my physical features.
Now that I am very comfortable, I pass on opportunities to be unfaithful. Ditto her. We joke about it.
We have no secrets. I have access to her phones and emails as she does mine. That reduces the temptation to misbehave.
My point is that there are some good women out there. The problem is finding the right one that wants you for who you are! Not so much about money or your career, although those are never a negative.

On a lighter note, I know lots of women who find bald (zero hair) men cool, sexy and confident."

"When they do this in during congestion it slows traffic more and also causes ""steals"" spaces from the traffic that is already on the highway or freeway.  The way it should work is you go to the end of the merging lane and then alternate with the people on the highway letting one person in ahead of them.  When someone jumps in before the end of the lane then they will be letting an additional car in ahead of them and everyone behind loses an extra couple of car lengths."
"So how can society combat fake news? By being right, and by being blunt about it.

Trump won the presidency because too many people thought 'somebody else' was going to stop him. Everybody laughed at Trump's antics, were appalled at his crassness, but played it up for cheap laughs. 
'Fake News' began with Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show', but in the last campaign ALL news decided that it wanted in on the joke. Tellingly, Jon Stewart, arguably the guy who made fake news popular, now comes off as an angry, critical, bitter crank, in his recent television appearances. Google the video of his appearance on Colbert, after the Republican Convention. 

Fighting 'Fake News' is going to take the media re-inventing itself in the mould of Mid 80's episodes of 60 minutes, with angry, ego-driven NEWS anchors kicking in doors, with cameras in tow, embarrassing offenders bluntly and publicly. No more thousand word think pieces on some obscure website.

Under HR 158, the visa and green card holders that Trump's EO blocked from entry into the US would be admitted because they've already been approved for their visas and free cards.  The Trump EO IS an outright and immediate ban on ALL people with citizenship from the Islamic 7 REGARDLESS of whether or not they have a valid US issued visa or green card.

"Trudeau has no choice but to refrain from saying anything against Trump, because Canada has to do its best to  get along with the US government, like it or not. 

Incidentally, Canada's situation in relation to the US reminds me to an extent of when I was in Portugal and I asked the tour director on our bus trip how his country gets along with Spain.  He said the two countries get along ok, and I then pointed out (and he agreed) that  Portugal has no choice but to do so, since Spain shares its sole land border.

"I've never understood where Trump got the reputation or idea that he was a good negotiator. Trump's idea of negotiation seems to be to promise the sky and the moon when he needs your co-operation then stiff you once the deal is done. If he doesn't need your co-operation then he tries to strong-arm you. What's worse, Trump thinks of negotiations as zero-sum contests where only he can win. The best negotiations are where everyone leaves happy but Trump only participates in negotiations where he leaves happy. 


After getting rid of Obama's negotiations nobody will negotiate with Trump in good faith, because they know any agreement with the USA will only good until the next president comes in. Don't expect any big trade deals while Trump is in power, and even if he does succeed in one don't expect it to go well for the USA."

"There is no longer any credibility in the denial of climate change.  One might just as well deny the reality of gravity.  Frankly, people who accept the findings of science in all aspects of their lives want to deny what scientists are telling us about our culture of death killing the planet.  Some deniers are simply ignorant of what's happening, while others fear having to change their greedy lifestyles, and still others would rather live in denial than face the truth.  Sadly, so long we delay taking serious action to preserve and nurture the world God gave us, the more people will suffer and die.  19 of the 20 so-called 'G-20' nations recently reaffirmed the reality of climate change and their commitment to the Paris Climate Accord.

This was a decent, hardworking man, not particularly prejudiced toward his black co-workers. There are decent Alabamians.

I hope the partisan people out there really think about what is best in regards to medical care.  Obamacare does nothing to control medical costs.  This is not sustainable.

"Walter, what you are forgetting is that her email contained over 2100 emails that were classified, that would be around 6% of the total emails turned over to State.

I also worked with classified information while in the Navy, all the way up to Top Secret, code word material and in my capacity, worked with material that had already been generated and marked classified. In her capacity as Secretary of State and her aides, they would have generated much classified material and it would have been up to the agency involved with the material to determine the classification and mark the material accordingly.

"There was more reason for May to call an election given the reaction many voters had after the Brexit vote and given the seriousness of the consequences.   In addition, what is not given much play in the Canadian media is how a Canadian ""voter profiling and targeting"" firm played a key role in rounding up support for the Brexit position.   That may have been why there was a 10% discrepancy between the result and the pollsters ahead of the vote.

The thing that is odd in all of this, though, is how Article 50 was triggered ahead of the election.   It's almost as though the result now obtained is what they (whoever ""they"" is) were seeking in order to pursue a ""soft"" Brexit."

These announcements are very well timed it seems. As if they were waiting to see where this legislative session was going in terms of oil tax credits and all the other hullamara that the house and the governor have splayed. I give Tammie Wilson credit for doing her homework and exposing the outrageous Alaskan govt sucking noise that is still at the door. It seems like there is no money they will not consider spending. It's completely unreal to believe that anything they do or say will have any impact at all on fighting for the states economic future. It's truly sad.
"Ok, that makes absolutely no sense. Plus it doesn't even remotely answer the question about ""national morality"".

It is unfortunate that there is no real agreed upon idea of what confirmation is supposed to be...that leads to a wide variation of ages of reception/administration and required preparation (if any)."

"Now, DonInKansas, I can tell by your frequent smileys that you love Jesus so much that you could hardly open your mind to this, but it's true:  Peter's use of the sword against civil authority was not clearly an act of self-defense.  The soldier was under orders to make a lawful arrest, and had a duty to carry out that order.  Peter, by opposing lawful civil authority, was ""living by the sword,"" i/e/. using the sword without just cause.  Further, Peter was unwittingly trying to obstruct God's will for Jesus.  The fact that Jesus' trial later turned out to be a kangaroo court does not alter the nature of the soldier's act or his duty.

Furthermore, if Jesus had intended that Peter never again use the sword under any circumstance, would he have told Peter to put it back in its place (as he said), or instead, to throw it away?"

Daily carry may be necessary in a war-zone, but not in state-side barracks.  Ammo is restricted because it ""vanishes"" so often, mostly due to unofficial, off-base target practice.  Troops could be issued individual gun lockers, but it is much more efficient to manage inventory and control weapons in the armory.  Terrorist acts on U. S. military bases is a relatively new phenomenon, and the bureaucracy is responding in its usual glacial manner."

"I'm not sure what conditions must be met to elevate the top tax level to 92% that experts and accountants are arguing with their worst case scenario, but paying taxes between 70% to over 90% on anything is outright robbery.

Your company essentially becomes the host for this parasitic government that drains you dry. On top of the excessive taxation the Liberals still leave the burden of you having to pay the annual accountant and lawyer fees to keep the company living for them if you have anything left after they get done with you. The only thing that can be done is leave the money sit idle until a far better Conservative government gets elected.

They have already sold or donated items of great sentimental and monetary value, items which were gifts to the senior citizens of Issaquah, not to the Board. Replacing them will require the use of taxpayer monies.

The Board has refused to give the City a full and transparent accounting of Center finances and to adhere to federal nondiscrimination laws. Members of the Center have been denied the civil rights guaranteed them by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Since the City was extremely cautious in dealing with this crisis over a period of 20 months, shouldn’t we know what lies the secretary of the Board claims the City told? 

A forensic accounting of Center finances since 2008 is the minimum needed to protect our seniors and prevent anyone from ever profiting again to their detriment."
"You can most definitely patent a process... the same way you can patent a drug... pretty much the only way chemists make money. It costs a lot of time and money to research a method, or a process, on how to make or extract a compound, or drug, and if you do that, you are entitled to monies from whoever wishes to copy said formula. It's pretty much the basis of the entire biotech industry so I don't know why I need to explain this. Fact is they have a cost effective and efficient process to derive these compounds at high purity which are widely used and sought after. There there is a growing demand not only as a skin product, but as a way to help lower cholesterol. The preliminary trials for that are looking very positive, and once published, there is then access to a industry which is worth billions. Aveeno is a company which already purchases from Ceapro.. it's the active ingredient in their products, so yeah I've checked them out. 100 years of MD's concentrated in one drop. Nice."

I also believe that most conservatives do not really want guns in the hands of the insane or people like this yahoo.     The problem lies in the way to do it.  With nukes, it almost has to be the way we are going about it.  With some force behind it.   Now with guns, it has to be more individualized and more laws are not necessarily the answer.   We have enough laws on the books.  It has to be more person to person.  Neither nukes nor guns are in of themselves the problem, it is the people using them.   Really with both that is where the ultimate solution lies."

I would support taxpayer funded vouchers for private schools but only on one condition: that students in every public school receive equal opportunity, i.e. per pupil funding equal to that in the most expensive private school that accepts vouchers.  So if a private school has per pupil funding through donations, tuition, and vouchers of say $25k, every public school in the state would receive $25k per pupil.
Of course, ""pro-choice"" folks don't want that.  They want even greater inequality of opportunity by taking money away from public schools to fund voucher programs for wealthier parents."

It could cost the the country about 2 million jobs if $200 billion a year is removed from the system. Much of the money is going to pay people from expensive doctors and administrators to lowly paid health care aids. ( one job = $100K) The health industry employs about 11% of all workers. It has been largely immune to recessions due to the way government subsidies and insurance payments have operated so far. About a third of my relatives work in the health industry.

"It often is... but on the high side.  Not sure about the south end, but I-25 north of Denver really shouldn't have the 75 MPH speed limit on it that it does. There's WAY too much traffic for that speed, IMO.  It was fine with less traffic, but there's near constant compression points along the way now where you're doing 75 then have to slam on the brakes.  It's just not a very safe road at that speed with this much traffic.

IMO, they need to lower it to 70 or even 65.  Or better yet, install traffic sensors and electronic speed limit signs and employ variable speed limits.  When traffic is light, use a 75 MPH speed limit; when it's heavy drop it to 65."
"While I get that the theory of supply & demand predicts that increased property development will reduce housing prices, in real life it usually has the opposite effect.  Or at least that's what I've observed ... but of course like most economic theories, it can't ever be proven or disproven.

It does seem that every major stimulation of real-estate development is accompanied with a burst in market speculation, which draws a bunch of foreign money into the marketplace & drives up the price of everything. That might be the economics-based theory of why we don't see this supply/demand effect on housing that we keep hoping for.

I would love to see Oregon, or at least Portland, place a specific tariff on non-resident real estate investment, and use that to subsidize low-income housing.

Re: ""Widespread condemnation by Muslims...""  Well, on this page we have lots of snorts and sneers about our leader(s) doing that sort of knee-jerk ""It's expected"" reaction to mayhem in our midst.  

 I'd like to read/see/hear stuff about Muslims on a continual basis. That's part of what I believe Khan is saying. Her community is mostly silent. What are they REALLY thinking, feeling, doing? Are these folks joining Rotary? Are they volunteering in their (wider) communities? They keep a really low profile.  That's OK--lots of us do.  But when our ethnicity/religion is under scrutiny--even suspicion--as it is in this case, the people under the microscopeneed to show and tell. Continuously. Do we hear a radio feature, ""Inside the Neighbourhood Mosque""?  Nope. Do we see public service TV spots about ""Islam In Canada!""  Nope.  Even get profiles of Home Hardware folks, for Pete's sake.

Francis is an enigma to me.  He says really good things, and the way he lives is personal life is refreshing, and truly admirable. But at the same time, he seems to miss some really big things, often seeming to err on the side of clericalism. The scandal is probably as good an example of this as any.  He KNOWS that the laity wants accountability, yet, he walked away from his ""tribunal"" idea, and appears to have all but abandoned the Commission. Both of those were greeted with high hopes from the laity. I for one was truly saddened to read Maria's piece when she quit, and mentioned that she never even got to talk to the pope. Guess he has more important things to do...

The gap exists, but I strongly suspect that's what's giving the Spirit room to work. Something new will emerge, and I fear the bishops will be the last to see it. At our core, we still thirst for good news, for meaning, for compassion, and wisdom.  That's the hope, and the seed..."

During that project, I was asked by the hotel where I was staying not to bring ""those people"" to the hotel (I left and slept at the band office). I also realised, that in my late 30's I had never learned a single word from any of Canada's 54 native languages in my supposedly multicultural country.

"Catalonia was the last province to fall to Franco, with the Nationalist troops marching into Barcelona in March, 1939. The head of the Catalan government, Luis Company's, escaped into France. In 1940, he was captured by the Gestapo and turned over to the Franco police. He was executed shortly thereafter with no trial, but not before being sadistically tortured by the fascists. The best source on the Spanish Civil War is still Hugh Thomas' The Spanish Civil War.

"A few lies told by Cohen and spread by the globalist, progressive MSM:

1) The first allegiance for an honorable Southern man in 1861 was his native state.  Like many other West Point Rebels, General Lee made the extremely difficult decision to defend his home state against the invading Union.

To do otherwise would have made him a traitor to his first allegiance.

2) General Lee believed in manumission;  his will stipulated that.  He believed that before blacks could be freed they had to be educated and taught a skill so that they could prosper in society.

3) General Lee and many other Southerners believed that slavery would eventually die out on its own without war.  That's exactly what happened in Brazil.

4) The false equivalence between Southerners trying to defend their homeland and Nazis is disgusting.  The Nazis were in favor of genocide for many groups and wanted world hegemony.  General Lee and his army just wanted to keep the Yank barbarians out of Virginia.

It is doubtful that Denali would have become a national park if miners hadn't built the access roads to the mines in Kantishna.

Today though there are 88 seats in SK, AB and BC combined vs. only 78 seats in Quebec.  The Atlantic Provinces, meanwhile, still have the same 32 seats that they had in 1980.

Ontario is still the big battleground, with 121 seats in the house.  The real question here is who is going to take the 60 or so suburban seats in Ontario.  Downtown Toronto will vote Liberal or NDP and rural Ontario will vote Conservatives, but there are a lot of seats up for grabs in between those two."

The quietly announced proposal will require electricity ratepayers to fully underwrite the coal scam. 

 How lucky is that ?, …you lucky winners.

A number of steps have already been taken to try to tamp down home prices in these two markets, but this regulatory move by OSFI is not isolated to Toronto and Vancouver. People in towns across the country will be impacted by this move including those in already depressed housing markets. It is not OSFI's mandate to influence housing prices. There mandate is to manage the risks within the financial system. If this was about that, then why did OSFI not make a move in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis when institutions were at their most vulnerable? Financial Institutions have never been stronger. This move does nothing to accomplish its raison d'etre and only layers on another policy aimed at slowing two housing markets. But at what cost?"
"Reasonable people can agree to disagree.  I see this a bit differently.  The Dems moved to center right under Bill Clinton, which was several political generations ago.  The Tea Party was not a reaction to that era, but rather a reaction to the economic downtown started under Bush and bleeding into the Obama administration.  Democrats have become increasingly left of center just before and during the Obama years, including HRC.  I know that many Dems feel that trending left is the answer both philosophically and politically.  But I believe that cost them the mid terms under Obama and the last general election.  They are trying to lead people somewhere vs. represent the views of the majority of their voters.  I would advise them to move to the center if they want to win elections, and especially win with a real mandate.  Politics, after all, is the art of compromise.  Unlike religion."

I can almost guarantee that more health spending will just boost health salaries again, without changing the system or ensuring timely, quality care. There is so much needed, and such a slim chance it will actually be done.

To all those partisan liberals and conservatives out there, your loyalty may be admirable...or simply incredible. Both parties got us into this financial and ethical mess.

Follow the money folks.  This was an economic decision for the US that clearly reverses the dopey decision making of the prior administration.  The corporate beneficiaries of this bad decision making are worried that their billionaire lifestyles will be reduced to mere multi-millionaire status.  I guess going forward it will be hard to get more dates with Amber Heard."
It would be very interesting to learn what if anything has been done to ensure this miscarriage of justice is not repeated in the future.  Reassigning folks who drop the ball just moves the problem elsewhere.  What revised or new procedures have been put in place to preclude other children from suffering the same tragic harm.  Sadly the current System is broken.  The Valientes are to be commended for trying to force required changes.

The issue of sequestration amounts and time are not explored in enough depth and may appear to be better solutions to a long term problem than they are.  Soil may retain 20% of the carbon but will become saturated in 20-30 years.  Trees have longer term sequestration and may retain that carbon for decades to centuries. The carbon that is being added by burning fossil fuels was sequestered in the order of thousands to millions of years. The use of shorter term sequestration may delay the problems but longer term sequestration must be found.
"One can change the terms to whatever one wants but the reality is that the people who have to underwrite the costs of this issue are never going be recconciled to it or accept it as a normal element of the human state.

The way they slipped by the refusal to rationalize the oil credit/tax legislation and ram through the Permanent Fund raid is more than egregious, it's thievery.

Your comment suggests an excellent course of action: leave Zuma to Putin to deal with. We should protect our country first. 'Zuma (and family/friends)' is now of little consequence to us.
It's sad that the only people who are fighting to preserve this country are natives. They are the ones who notice the Canadian governments goal to  increase the population to 63.5 million people by 2063 and what that will do to the landscape. Slowly developers are chipping away at our country piece by piece. Native Canadians are working to keep beauty of our wilderness just as it is. There is nothing wrong with that.

On the one hand, we could make it illegal to access salafist websites, prosecute imams who counsel terrorism and ensure that no one can take up residence in the country except after a thorough security check which takes months.

On the other hand, we could permit anyone who arrives at an unauthorized border entry point to enter the country with only the most perfunctory of checks (shhh no one tell Daesh!) and burble on ad nauseam about solidarity and diversity being our strength.

Clearly the second alternative stands to make us safer!"
"They give them a cheese sandwich.  The ""We will feed every kid, every day"" is what they've been doing, whether there was money to do it or not.  Maybe you need to talk to parents who haven't applied for the federal school lunch program and thus presumably have money to feed their kids, but choose to let the school give them a free cheese sandwich.  Maybe THEY need to cut spending.

The school isn't ""cutting spending"" - cafeterias are not funded by education dollars.  They are like a restaurant - the money that comes in from the federal government for the lunch program for the poor, and from parents from the not-so-poor, funds the materials and labor to produce lunches.  Far from cutting spending, they are borrowing from somewhere to cover the cost that parents refuse to pay."
Obama was not qualified to make a cup of coffee and still isn't.
Exactly on point. For all we know the worst of the worst is coming here. Those cities should be completely cut off from any funding until the issue is resolved. If they disobey take it to the provinces and cut off funding. They can deal with it amicably through government or through protests of citizens who oppose which I would assume would be a sizeable amount of citizens.

Furthermore if I hold that my point of view alone is correct, that necessarily means the position that 'no point of views are correct' is false.

"There may not have been doctrine about chattel slavery in America. There does not have to be to condemn the Church's inaction. Legalism in the face of such things is cowardice. In this case, no doctrine was as bad as wrong doctrine or worse allowing bad proof texting regarding scriptures on slavery, which were underlined by the belief that the end was near and all slaves would be free anyway. Bad proof texting is not doctrine, but it can be part of it, like those regarding receipt of Communion when you don't believe it is real (mortal sin was not a thing in ancient times) or reading too much into Mark regarding divorce, if you wish to be relevant to this article. Sadly, bad proof texting can become traditional doctrine, which does not render it less bad. Bad proof texting adds authority to bad doctrine and usually no one had the courage to object.

"I think you have presented an important component of 21st century grids –minigrids. Minigrids are the way things are evolving where there are remote locations where central power is not easy and has not come.  They start with some solar panels and even old fashioned batteries with modern solid state devices that use low current DC like cell phones and LEDs. Low current and low voltage with 12V or 24V which the whole automotive/RV world operates on.
We have DC minigrids now that are in things like sever stations that operate at 380 VDC.  A lot of saving not doing AC to DC conversions both in terms of electrical efficiency and heat n the case of server stations. We need good home wiring and grid standards to allow these efficiencies to be added.
There are multiple forms of storage both at the home level and the larger minigrid level."

Donald Trump is clearly making it up as he goes along, and all the people with whom he has surrounded himself are having to go behind him cleaning up his mess like pet owners observing the pooper-scooper law.

"How do we trust this news source?  A chance to teach our community about the great work that miniature horses are doing in our community has been spoiled by an inaccurate article.

Eileen and Diesel are great friends of ours.  They are fantastic!  So generous with their time and talents.  The road to becoming a registered therapy horse can be challenging.  Eileen and Diesel were the first of our close group of new mini owners to make that trip.  Rod Seevers and Raindrop are the second pair to have become registered therapy partners.  They also are regular visitors to Harrison.  They participated in The Relay For Life in Central Kitsap and by invitation in North Kitsap.  They also visited a local horse camp to educate campers.  Martha & Mary  in Poulsbo has also opened their doors to the minis.

Therapy visits are a  labor of love.  Fitting preparation in to a life that includes full time employment can be tricky.

The legislation should have reflected this.  It would have satisfied most people, including those in Quebec.  There is no need for a woman to stay unveiled longer than necessary.
 To date, there has been no discussion of employment probably because there are so few niqab wearers and most are homemakers.  What's going to happen when some applies for a public facing  job wearing one or what's going happen when someone applies for a job without one and starts wearing one once they get the job?  An employer is supposed to make every reasonable attempt to accommodate religious beliefs.   It's not a problem now but if  the number niqab wearers grows it might become one."

"Some thing is not right here. Rogers is still beating profit expectations and rewarding their shareholders. I can only surmise that their performance can be attributed to their underhanded practices at confusing customers with their purposely designed bundled service plans and questionable customer retention strategies. Rogers' goal is to squeeze as much money out of their customers and deliver as little value as possible, which is admirable from a business fundamentals point of view but the lack of competition in Canada in this space means that Rogers can screw with their customers quite a bit with minimal negative effect (only lost 18k TV subscribers!!!).

George Zimmerman was in his 30s at that time and as an adult should have been able to de-escalate the situation and could have by simply NOT FOLLOWING Martin to begin with. 

Martin and all of us We have a right to not be stalked nor do we have to answer any question by any person NOT A COP as zimmerman wasn't. Zimmerman provoked a confrontation and he knows it. The only reason he got off is because FLA state laws don't recognize degrees of manslaughter. And since he story is the only one told the DA went with that.

    There are nicely balanced responses here. The point brought forward is certain lobbyists need to be watched very closely. Strange stuff has been pushed quietly into law and regulation. Responsible recreational folks find themselves spending vast amounts of free time fighting often unreasonable restrictions, while other extremists of both ilk create hard feelings and can denigrate quality of life."

The talking heads were foolishly trying to blamed  Andersen for the recent high goals against, but the fault comes from the Buds' general effort to push for  increased offence which has resulted in their decrease  of forechecking and tighter coverage.  Again not a bad game, but they have to bring the goals against down to two or less, to win, from here on in."

Matthew 5: 44

Luke 6:27

Luke 6:29

And, of course, that perennial favourite, Matthew 26:52. (It's about living by the sword and dying by it.)

As I said, Jesus is not silent about love and calls for love of all, even of enemies. Is it an act of love towards an enemy to kill him against his will? I don't think so. Nor does Jesus. (See those verses I listed.)

Nothing  contrary to love about defending yourself? Well, there is if, by defending yourself, you take the other guy's life. At least, that's Jesus' view.

What?!!!!! Jesus' death was the sole purpose of his incarnation? You are kidding me, aren't you? The sole purpose of Jesus' mission was to love his Father, in our name, and for which he died. The Father isn't some loony-toon sadist!

That story, of the woman, is proof that not everything in the L and Ps met with Jesus' approval. His reaction proves my point.

"Clouds also trap heat close to the surface, raising overnight temps especially, when cloud cover has no albedo effect because there's no sunlight to reflect. 

And although clouds probably reflect diurnal solar radiation back into space, clouds are, at least in part, water vapour, and water vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas. So if cloud formation is linked to available water vapour, you'd have to also account for the POSITIVE feedback impact of increased water vapour--which increase is directly proportional to temperatures--and you'd also have to account for the nocturnal warming effect of cloud cover.  Clouds are not simple albedo.

The thing I'm reacting to is Unknown Commenter's citing ONE article in a marginal publication as evidence that 157 years of greenhouse theory is wrong. That's kind of ludicrous, and typical of the clutching at straws denier favor over sound reasoning and method. Let me know when similar findings show up in Science, Nature, or the Proceedings."

This is also recognizing, I think, the fact that the burqa is basically the dress-code of Islamic fundamentalists and hard-line Islamists."

"You can't drive and talk on a cell phone but you can still endanger yourself, other cars and pedestrians by driving on icy streets and intersections with no more than worn (un-inspected) summer or all-season tires in most provinces in Canada. And you don't need a lot of snow to cause havoc. Edmonton falls to pieces most mornings after only a few cms of snow, and even without it, cars warming-up spew lots of water on roads that commonly refreezes in the core winter months each morning. Snow tires ought to be mandatory (as in Quebec) to ensure greater safety and long commuting delays when the latest dusting sends people into the ditches.  And if the provinces won't, insurance companies could still happily raise their rates for those drivers who chose not to buy snow tires. Safety shouldn't be an option."

That's because you're probably not old enough to have witnessed them first hand.

They pretty much have to let Catholicism wither, first.

I first learned of Clouston in May 1990 while watching CBC's excellent documentary of the 50th anniversary re-enactment. The 40 minute film devoted almost 4 minutes to Clouston.

I was stunned. I considered myself to be quite well-informed about Canada's role in the Second World War yet here was a fellow Montrealer who had done so much during a monumental event... yet I'd never heard of him?

I subsequently contacted our War Museum but they said they could do nothing re. Clouston because he did not serve with a Canadian unit.

Thankfully, I videotaped the documentary (""We Shall Fight on the Beaches!"") and showed it my students every November. I wrote to various Canadian media prior to the 70th and 75th anniversaries, asking them to highlight this 'unknown Canadian hero of Dunkirk' but none of them replied.

The recent film has provided an opportunity, perhaps the last, to give Clouston some well-earned recog'n."

"Wow! Extreme ignorance or willful disregard for Jesus' hard spent time on this earth! Jesus most definitely condemned homosexuality. His condemnation was clear to every sinner whom he confronted when he told them that if they chose to repent , they were forgiven...with the stipulation that they go and sin no more. Jesus knows people are not perfect, but that lack of perfection does not in the least justify anyone living a lifestyle of sin. His motto was if you are truly sorry, you have my forgiveness, but I expect you to knock it off. He didn't die on the cross for us to keep sinning! He died on the cross to help those of us who mess up get forgiveness and have a second chance to do right.

These are the characteristics of an administration focused on blind power.    A minority of Americans now  have 'the good King' who will fix everything to fit their world view without  the annoyance of Congress, Press, or the Courts.    That's a bad dream for me.  I pray I'm wrong.

"The GM just recently had an analysis from Stats Can showing where the big salaries are in Canada, and not surprisingly it is in the oil and gas sector in the west. When our economy started to rebound earlier this year , it was due in large part to the resource sector. The huge transfer payments that Quebec gets some where past $11B, comes the oil and gas rich west, which explains their current anger.  We have resources which have allowed us to be the envy of countries around the world, and our strategy is to put as many obstacles in the way as possible to extract these resources. Perhaps oil is on the way out and new technologies will replace it, then all the more reason to make the money while you can. If you were holding a stock that if sold now would generate substantial profit, and you knew that eventually it would be worth little, why would you then hang on to that stock. That seems to be the current position, oil is going to replaced so lets leave the money in the ground."

Bingo.  Well said.
All professions require constant education to remain proficient. The licensing requirements you list are union created barriers to entry and have nothing to do with outcomes. For proof look at the dismal performance of teachers locally and nationally as compared to other countries.
"Lately, in North America at least, we've been tolerating too many human rights violations (e.g., discrimination against homosexuals) in the name of religious freedom.

In a secular democracy, only those aspects of religion that do not infringe on people's human rights should be protected from discrimination (e.g., not eating pork, keeping the sabbath); the aspects that do infringe on others' human rights (e.g., restricting women's reproductive rights, inciting hate of homosexuals) should not be tolerated.

Now, with Singh being both religiously orthodox AND the leader of the NDP, not to mention an uncritical supporter of the niqab and burqa, it is legitimate to worry that he may be overly biased toward religious freedom vs. all other human rights.

Similarly, it was to be expected that Harper, as an Evangelical Christian at the head of the Conservatives, would crusade against abortion (well, until the topic proved too unpopular)."
"The other factor here at play is that most of the American talent pool has been a part of the US National Team Development program for teenagers, or played in the World Juniors, so they are well known to the USA Hockey brass.  Canada does not have a standing national team development program for 16, 17 and 18 year olds, as they have the far larger CHL/Major junior programs to do that level of development for them, so it's not surprising that their management needs the extra tourneys in Europe to evaluate talent that the USA might not need...."
"Sure, kpare, but if we don't get access to these highly skilled leaders in their field, there are no jobs for the new recruits.  As Canadian tech companies - I lead one - we don't know what we don't know.  Searching the world for the best talent to help us grow quickly (""scale"" as many like to call it) helps us add new junior positions that we're pleased to fill w Canadian kids.

""Society Crimes""? Gee...if someone is driving DUII and causes an accident with injuries or death?...is it reclassified Again?
Sounds like the City of Klamath Falls is just playing with the numbers by re-classifying crimes??"
Yes.  Put that option on the table for discussion.

But hey - Smith's choice."
"Trump doesn't reflect your values?  He seems to be about acquiring personal wealth, not paying taxes, (thereby putting the federal government in considerable added debt),   while at the same time maintaining and building on the world's most powerful military, and using that military at will, anywhere on earth; while de-funding environmental safeguards, lowering taxes on big business, and dismantling social services and public education, as well as health care, since that's all part of the socialist utopia...Did I miss anything?"
"I watched that, but I still don't know if they were for Brexit or not. Enlighten me, please? I didn't get chills. I got the usual angst from young folks, as it should be. But, I still don't get what they are saying as far as Brexit is concerned."
"Thank you for saying it out load.
The only thing America has to fear is herself."
"YES!  End Obamacare and dry up the already-shrinking government black holes that are ""ACA exchanges.""  A free and open insurance market and open, transparent pricing of medical services is all we need to fix our costs of medical care.  Doctors charge ONE price for every service, and customers compete for the lowest price.  Insurance companies charge ONE price- free of government strangulation and  regulation - and customers shop for the lowest price and best coverage.
.
Free markets, free of bloated government spending, free pricing structures, and free from government lies and corruption.  THAT is how we solve America's health cost crisis."

"The writing was on the wall long ago.  Successive governments of all stripes have been buying public service labour peace on the back of the tax payer for decades.  And now the bill has arrived.  The public service pension liability is unstainable. And taxation on the private sector has reached a point of diminishing returns (See Laffer).  It's unlikely this government has the cajones to pull back public servant benefits.  And previous Conservative governments have failed to address the matter.

That leaves the private sector to our own devices.  Those who can, will leave.  Others will adopt a cash-lifestyle.  The bulk however, will just give-up."
"Canada is all about the wealthy, workers or those trying to better themselves; never.

"Yes congrats,
The NYT giving editorial privileged to the DNC prior to going to print, the leaking of debate questions, burning Bernie with full compliance of the establishment are all examples of collusion and bias left wing  media.

"""He would have turned 18 this month.""
Instead, he killed someone in a crash and, later, died of his injuries.
Don't you think he paid for his action, whatever it was?
This wasn't his 2nd or 3rd DUI. He wasn't an experienced driver. He didn't walk away to be on his merry way. He did not live to see 18.
Tragic for everyone. Hard to fathom. 
I take it that you have never run a red light, had a close call behind the wheel. I know I have. I've also avoided crashes because of other driver's carelessness or whatever. 
It boggles my mind that you can be so resentful of a dead boy - of the friends who wish to honor him."
You missed the point.
"Yes, its not the 35 that need to be convince - its the 10%  in the middle ..."

Suicide is terrible, but to accuse ""White"" society of murder is a bit over the top."

I marked agreement for ur comment but i have to tell u that i laughed so hard and glad u said it. It also scary just thinking of the possibility of it ever being a practice. I wish something like this would work.
"Without governments to enforce a set of rules governing wealth, your savings could be worthless. Although we might think in Canada we are immune to social disorder or even revolution, without the support of the majority of people a society eventually becomes unstable. Who will protect your assets if we no longer have a functioning court system and police force. This is why it is important that those who find themselves in fortunate financial circumstances, be restrained in their attachment to their disproportionate level of wealth and that in order to maintain their affluence they need to realize that it takes the vast majority of people working together and contributing to the collective whole. If a tiny percentage of individuals keep taking most of the surplus wealth then sooner or later people will react."
Please leave His Honor the Mayor out of this. He is still busy trying to locate funds for soap for the public restrooms...
I like and have rate resets and perpetual shares as a component of my overall portfolio. They are considered fixed income but do not be fooled. These are an equity investment and needed to treated as such.  Just echoing other poster's comments.
"Regarding: ""The number of women serving as presidents of U.S. Catholic colleges has skyrocketed in the past 16 years — up 137 percent from 2000 to 2016, according to the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.""
- That this is a marvel depends on the base line, in this case - years 2000 - 2016.
- If extending the baseline to 1920 then the number of women presidents is seen to be a large number as the women's catholic colleges were lead, you guessed it, by women. 
- It seems the uniqueness of women serving as presidents in these days is that they are usually lay women, that is not consecrated women religious, and that they serve in universities that are now co-educational."
"Very well stated - unfortunately very few people are recognizing your (and many other small business) situations, including being ineligible for employment insurance, having to pay for your own health insurance and disability insurance (at very high rates because the business is too small to qualify for discounted insurance rates), no company pension plans ... what typically is left in a small business (passive investment) quite often covers periods where there is no income / when work is not available or having to be off sick ... the income sprinkling may be an issue with the very high end businesses - it is not something that is abused by small businesses typically as they follow the rules ... the people with the most money are more likely to be the ones who abuse the rules ..."

Fortunately that didn't happen. An inferior president was blocked on a regular basis by the House and Senate.
"The reason private timberland owners have locked gates is because they tired of having plastic bags of used diapers,  all the broken appliances,  stolen cars set on fire,  and dead women's bodies dumped on their land.  Whole logging jobs are shut down for days as the investigation slowly examines the area,  and everyone who used the road gets questioned.  Easier to lock the gates,  and keep them locked,  and like in all aspects of communal life in America,  the many are unjustly penalized by the actions of the few."
"Just exactly what does the doctor think the world should have done? When the Arab spring broke out many of us naively hoped that democracy was about to spread through the middle east. Instead it unleashed centuries of tribal and religious hatred leading to chaos. As has been said, democracy cannot be imposed, it must rise from within. Hard to see that happening when we can't even figure out who the good guys are. Maybe there aren't any."

"We once prided ourselves and were prolific in proclaiming how ""democratic"" and all empowering our constitution was. Yet none off us could have foreseen the possibility that we would awaken a ""leader"" that would have the power to alter and ignore the very institution put in place to protect our beautiful nation. Even here there are loop holes. And Jacob Zuma has perfected the art off working those loop holes. One can say we should have seen the warning signs. We gave a man hell bent on gaining absolute power to rule us. To call him the elephant in the room is the biggest understatement if ever there was one. Those that placed him there and still hero worship him must in some way be held accountable. Maybe the time has come to revisit our constitution. The loop holes need to be closed. Jacob Zuma must be held accountable."

Why do they pick astronauts who are in their 40's?  Way too old to be spacemen!  Guess the 20 - 30 year olds are mostly enlisted in programming them into outer space at NASA.  How ironic.
"The most glaring problem is the disrespect shown our country by these overpaid athletes.

You can blame QB's, DB's OL, etc, but look inward, these misinformed, way out of line athletes, spend far too much time composing endzone celebrations, tackles made, passes blocked down, whatever bit of trivial event happens on the field.  And now, are 'protesting' their country, as 'unjust' 'unfair' when 6% of the population, black males, do over 50% of the crime.  I have no idea of what they desire, but know it's unachiveable.  Has anyone asked them?  Most won't know what they are protesting,  I, for one, have no idea."
"We will never know if the russian disinformation campaign threw the the election to Trump or not.  But the ""russian thing"" is far from over, there are many ties between Trump's associates and russian oligarchs and organized crime groups that will keep the investigators busy for years.  Garland may have failed the NRA's 2nd admendment litmus test, but that does not mean he was unqualifed.  Actually, there are almost no qualifications per se for being a supreme court judge.  And with the fillibuster gone, the nomination process will just be a series of ideological litmus tests for whatever party has the majority in the senate."
"Wow.  You're one to talk about racism, after the thing's you've posted about First Nations."

"I understand your objection perfectly well. This isn't a question of how soon they turn a profit - it's a question of whether or not there's any development at all.  This is not the gravy train you've misunderstood it to be. 

The difference between tax breaks and incentives is the restrictions and qualifications they come with. If they're not well-balanced, we end up with Capstone. If they are well balanced, we have thriving city neighborhoods or districts that more than pay for the tax breaks once the tax break period is over. That sort of long-term thinking is why these tax breaks, if done right, pay off many times for tax payers. Unfortunately, much of the voting public reaches for the pitchfork every time they hear ""tax break"", no matter how unequipped those members of the public are to understand the larger picture."

"Never, it is who he is.    I have never considered him a suitable candidate for public office.   We may have pushed political correctness too far, but there are very good reason for a public figure to hold their cards close to their vest.    Words will ALWAYS be taken out of context by opponents and twisted to hang the speaker.    It's stupid and can only be seen by a narcissist as 'good' for them.

You don't mess up alliances by being stupid with what you say.     Trumps EQ is as low as I've ever seen in a public figure.     He's not honest, he makes huge factual errors all the time, and being emotionally out of control has never been a standard for wisdom."
Endless warfare for no reason
"I suspect R&R is not all that familiar with Baum's theology.  The fact Baum admitted he was in a gay relationship negates anything the man did in his entire life. As mystikali notes, for the conservative Catholic there is no forgiveness for those gay 'disordered acts'.  I pray that when I die, I will find out that God is not a conservative Catholic."

"I find no difficulty in answering your question or replying to what you said.  Your allegation that I evaded what you said is false.  But I note that you again evaded a fair question, i.e., ""If you think Jesus did not intend to be taken literally on divorce, what do you think he intended to tell us, and why do you think he intended to say THAT rather than what he actually said? 

Now, I'll respond to your remarks, above: You compare Jesus's obvious figurative saying ""If thine eye offend thee""  ---- you DO take that figuratively, don't you?  --- with his commandment not to divorce except for adultery.  They are as different as night and day.  After Jesus told the Pharisees that divorce was permitted only for adultery, the Pharisees (like you) did not accept his answer. and they asked him: ""Why then did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"" 
cont'd"
"To be clear, this is a protest of liberal-left women and not representative of all women in general.  That aside, I hope they have a fine day of protest empowering themselves.

  Sadly, their message will be lost as the incoming President has no record of note as President that verifies their concerns.  This results in their message being of no consequence.   The organizers should have waited.  They did not.  Their intent was a warning, which has been lost amongst the celebration of many, and particularly, the President."

"(Part one of three)  In the article by Orlandar Brand-Williams and Mark Hicks

Detroit Archbishop Vigneron has said leaders “needed to go back and look at the fundamental mission and in light of that, what do we have to change.”  The first thing to change is to remove the fear of thinking and its corollary, fear of reading.

Stephanie Quesnelle, 26, of old Royal Oak, attends St. Hyacinth Roman Catholic Church in Detroit’s Poletown neighborhood.  And not where she is supposed to attend.  Nationality parishes were abolished years ago.  Accepting what the Teaching Magisterium has to say about which parish to belong is another starting point.  Apparently both Quesnelle and Weldeab are thinking for themselves about which parish to attend, despite Canon Law.

Other local Catholics like Heywan Weldeab of Canton Township also found the event helpful. A lifetime member of St. Elizabeth Catholic Church in Detroit . . ."

"I understand the purpose of the protest but question the value. Besides providing a sense of accomplishment to organizers and lots of 'feel good' by attendees, was anything achieved? 
Do you think that anyone's views were changed because of the protest marches? We're any commitments made by anyone in power? Were there any financial or political targets set so that results could be measured?
Or was it all just a big global Koom-By-Yah by the campfire with a group hug afterwards?

"More fake news, Foster? 

Seriously, this whole Russian Conspiracy came about because the left is mad that so many people voted for Trump. If you watched his campaign you would have seen how huge his rallies were and how much support he had and still has. It was a legitimate election determined by legitimate voters. I did not vote for Trump in the primary, but he is now my President and I am glad he is. He is probably the only R candidate who will stand up against against the tactics of the left's lies. Him calling out the main steam media's 'fake news' sites has been refreshing, and long overdue.

Planned Parenthood was the only health care I could afford in my early twenties. They detected pre-cancerous changes on my pap smear and provided treatment, something that would not have been possible at any other health care provider, due to lack of insurance. Planned Parenthood is a necessary, vital resource that needs to remain available to women and men."

"Agree with everything you wrote except comment about height ... women may prefer taller men, but don't believe the hype that it's a sure thing.  

Reality is that there are some women out there who have their ""sh!t"" together and don't follow the mass hysteria that seems to describe too many women these days.  

Women who chase those ""tall tugged men"" typically have their own problems long before they get into relationships and if a woman can't see you for who you are and recognize your worth then you're better off without her.  

I'd suggest you stop chasing those women and do what you love to do, live the best life you can and likely you will meet a decent woman who recognizes you as a great guy.  

Be grateful for the women who turn you down -- they're probably doing you a huge favour!"

"Sometimes (and perhaps most times), the largest benefits of immigration are those due to the second generation (i.e., the children and grandchildren of the original immigrants).

They often told me of their parents' struggles to be accepted and to have their skills recognized (many of them had degrees in engineering, medicine, pharmacy, etc., but were too busy simply making enough money at low-skill jobs to take the time it would have taken to upgrade their skills). They always had a sense of owing it to their parents to become successful, and they worked hard at it and many of them are now contributing greatly to this country."

"At the end of the article it said that we could speed up the hearings, which was followed by the statement that there are no easy solutions. Isn't that an easy solution, speed up the hearings and deportations. The current situation seems to be lets hope it goes away. This isn't a solution it is conflict avoidance. The not too subtle point is that we have a PM who has gone on the world stage building an image of peace , love and an open door policy to refugees. By painting himself into the proverbial corner he can't now take a tough stand, hence the comments the other day, asking refugees to respect the rules. Most of the current border crosses are Haitian , and Montreal has a large Haitian population already, so it is safe to assume that most if allowed to stay will end up there. One could safely make the argument that if Montreal doesn't care, certainly the mayor doesn't, and the Quebec government doesn't care, then it's there problem to deal with."

Cacao beans are a natural drug.  They contain up to 2.2 percent phenylethylamine, the ‘love and sex’ chemical.  Cacao beans contain other compounds that enhance mood, joy, creativity and imagination.  

 Research at West Virginia’s Wheeling Jesuit University suggests that chocolate may boost your memory, lengthen your attention span, shorten your reaction time and strengthen your problem-solving skills as it increases blood flow to the brain.

"The United Nations has publicly stated its goal is not to ‘solve’ climate change, but to seek to redistribute wealth and expand its authority through more central planning. UN official Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group III, admitted what’s behind the climate issue: “One must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy … One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.”

Let's face it, SK has had over 60 years to establish better relations with NK.  They didn't do anything but rely on the U.S. for protection.  They totally underestimated NK.  Now that NK has nukes, the U.S. cannot protect them so they better start talking to NK fast."

"Just to the Internet. Heterodoxy is about early Church credal issues, not every word that comes from the pen of the Pope. By the way, the Filioque is considered Heterodox, an addition to the Creed by Rome. So much for it not changing or being corrected. DF was about the Church having a monopoly on explaining the revelation of scripture (which modern study has found is not pure revelation at all but a mix of myth, natural law reason, didactics and social commentary (in the OT) and pastoral letter and recalled events (NT). Such analysis is important in understanding scripture and morality. That Pio Nono did not think so does not surprise me. You should know better and if you don't, please seek the truth. Most parishes include programs on scriptural history at some point as do local Catholic colleges. Or just find a book on it that does not promote Triumphalism.

I resonate with the view of non-Adventists (depending on the sphere) and especially other Christians. They are  as kind and even more so than many church members. I used to wonder why socialization was so difficult in college. (I was baptized at 17) I think it had to do with the insular life-style. All the guys seemed terribly shy and we had no guidance on how to interact with each other,
 I wouldn't change my Adventism. It got me out of a lonely existence in a rural area and because of its emphasis on education, allowed me a pathway to college. Of course, I can't relate to the author's family situation, but I can see the stifling effect it must have had on him. I must say I am comfortable with my personal faith if not the organizational goings on. I find much intellectual challenge in the theology and feel free to disagree with some of it."

"Yeah, it's a weird tension between Trump energizing his group but also being saddled with high negatives from the rest of the GOP (and energizing a small group of some Dems but even higher negatives for the rest). Is the turnout for Trump or also against him? He polled mostly around 40% on Super Tuesday. But Clinton has high negatives as well, so people that might vote ""anti-Trump"" might not be willing to do that by voting for Clinton and vice versa."
"Keonimay, I believe your comment about our soldiers being sent into Laos, Cambodia and China is fiction stranger than fact.

I don't care about Sloter, I don't care about Kelly, I like the cheap price on Brock but don't really care about that, I care about the season and Trevor is the starter.

"""Amen, I say to you, Judge not, lest that you be judged. For the full measure that you mete out shall be meted un to you...Before you point out the speck in another's eye, take the plank out of your own."" 
In my experience most Catholics do not divorce out of convenience but rather dire, chaotic and even dangerous circumstances such as alcoholism, addiction and abuse. Staying together  ""for the kids"" in those types of circumstances is not advised. We might due well to remember that Christ does allow for divorce in cases of sexual immorality. Scratch one of those causes that I listed and see if you don't find such. 
So easy to judge those who have divorced and remarried isn't it? So easy to tell others how to navigate this difficult world. So easy to mark with the scarlet ""A"". Harder to try and understand that you don't know all. That communion, or not, is between the sinner and God. ""Sinner""? Yes, everyone approaching the altar is a sinner, don't kid yourself."

"""Unconscious bias explains why the higher echelons of government and business are still so pale and male. It explains why women are still so woefully shortchanged in STEM jobs (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). It explains why we need to move even more aggressively to recruit women and minorities...

When Canadian STEM schools graduate a diverse blend of 50% females and males for 35 or 40 years then in 35 or 40 years take a snap shot of the workplace and I strongly suggest there will still remain statistical inequities between men and women but it won't be because the higher echelons are significantly pale and male...there will be many other cultural/religious/ethnic factors in play that already hold both men and women back.

If as Margaret suggests we need to ""more aggressively recruit women and minorities"" and Canadian STEM schools aren't yet graduating a representative mix of the Canadian mosaic, will immigration policy support largely STEM female & minority hires?"

"This Broncos season cannot be blamed on Vance Joseph. It should be blamed on a complete lack of talent in many areas - starting with the quarterback. All of our QB's would be lucky to make the roster of any team in the NFL as a backup. That's what we have - backup quarterbacks. The offensive line is weak - allowing too many sacks, and not opening holes for the running backs. The defense is the Broncos strength, believe it or not after last game, but they're getting worn down by having to be on the field all the time. Vance Joseph may not be the greatest coach out there, but there aren't many coaches, if any, that could coach this team into a playoff team with the current roster. A new QB and a revamped offensive line (again) need to be their priorities."

We have 2 forms of the Roman rite, the ordinary and the extraordinary. The Roman rite is practiced whenever either is celebrated. That is an example of ""unity of practice"" that has ""various ways"" of being performed. Communion in one form is the same communion as in the other.

Your questions are all good ones, and I have no idea if I can answer them.:
with marriage, the differences between Poland and Malta are fewer than the differences between the extraordinary and ordinary forms imo. If I am right, it is an example of what Francis refers to in AL. There is no disruption in communion if there is none between the two forms of the Roman Rite.
AL is in a certain sense a collaborative effort between the synod and the Pope. I am not sure what you are asking.

"""It should also consider limits, or a ban, on foreign donations to groups that want to be registered as third parties during elections."" That's a start given that creating accounting can always allow organizations to claim that foreign funding wasn't for advertising.

Right wing, left wing, think tanks, institutes, advocacy groups, citizen coalitions, charities, whatever.  Doesn't matter. Get rid of it.

"DACA has caused unknown harm or death to those who trekked thru the Mexican wilderness, causing many to die from exposure, kidnapping, rape or sale into sexual slavery.

By his UNCONSTITUTIONAL act, as many as 800,000 have given over to the Federal Gov't their proof that they aren't US citizens, who are now tracked by said gov't. He also signaled to those below our southern border to risk their lives to come here. He even stated that he does not have the authority, but that it rests with Congress to change immigration law. It is now up to congress to fix it or have them deported. They have 6 months.

"The BC Liberals became so corrupt it is hard to imagine how they will rise above it. Extremism in leadership  has no place in a democracy. The BC Libs have courted the extreme while ignoring the common good. Worse yet, they would not follow the laws and developed a punitive and retaliative backlash to any challenge. Or else they simply ignored the issues and thumbed their noses at the public. Christy Clark acted like she was completely invincible regardless of her childish and outrageous conduct. The Libs did not care what the people thought or how tainted  their image had become. They demonstrated repeated conflict of interest. They abused power in every Ministry. They ignored the weak, vulnerable and marginalized. They governed without conscious and without a soul. They framed us into extremism. As far as their outlook for BC, what a shame - they trashed the picture and kept the frame."

Dull life ?  I'm living the dream . I fly all the time around the world.  I'm the voice of all those innocent people who died because of the pilots bad judgement and risk taking. It's beyond pathetic that even supposedly professional pilots in Alaska are making such terrible mistakes . Many have the same attitude as you---that life is a risk---so it's no big deal that so many pilots are taking so many innocent people to their deaths.  That you and I are writing about this subject means we have been lucky so far to have flown with pilots who did it right.  These pilots just don't seem to realize the responsibility these innocent passengers put in them . If they did they wouldn't pull all of these stupid stunts . In the past 60 years look at all the innocent people who have died because of these cowboys.  There must be a way to end the madness in Alaska. How many innocent passengers will die in Alaska this year ? How many innocent people will have to risk their lives searching for them ?

"The two texts you mention contain what I consider to be fundamental Christian beliefs. Note though that there have been some very good Christians, even saintly ones, who did not believe Jesus was the ""Word made flesh"" during their lives on earth, e.g. Paul and the authors of the gospels according to Mark, Luke, and Matthew. And according to the Orthodox, RCs don't fully and truly ""believe"" in the Nicene Creed, when they insist on inserting the Filioque.

It looks like quite an imposition on your part, that you demand of me if I ""believe"" these things. Who are you to ask me that? What do you want that information for? What would you do with it once you have it? Why should I trust you? Are you my judge? I should add here that I challenged you earlier regarding your rhetorical expression ""gift of life, God's gift,"" and you ignored it.

"So a publicly stated commitment by Mayor Ferrell and all councilmembers that there would be no tax implications of the PAEC has evolved to messaging that taxes being used for it is essential to our ""public health."" I enjoy good entertainment as much as the next person, but I do not believe going to a performance at the PAEC will keep our community healthy. Nor is paying $23+/show a viable option for many in Federal Way. City leaders (including me while a councilmember) committed to not allocating our tax dollars to offset PAEC construction or operations. There are numerous other things we could put our tax dollars toward that would go much further to ensure public health. This letter is intended to do one thing, to shape public perception that the PAEC is so good for us that we should be okay with our tax dollars being spent to bail out the city after Mayor Ferrell, Deputy Mayor Burbidge and certain councilmembers pushed it through without all the funds in place to pay for it."

This played out in the G&M as a series of lies, contradictions and denials by Canadian politicians that resulted in finally just changing the ""strongest export controls"" in the world in a sordid attempt to make the sale less repulsive.
And more importantly, Canadians heap as much praise on themselves as they did before the sale. Article writers continue to write the same holier than thou junk with the same smugness as they ever did. This sale, including the circus that led up to it, made a shambles of a whole host of supposed Canadian values that separate Canada from the rest of the world.

"Being a conservative, I love nothing more than taking the man to task on his politics, but his visits to the calico queens and brides of the multitudes, if they occurred at all, have little to do with anything concerning the running of the city in my opinion.

So, respectfully SEAN_EVERS_JR, why not crucify him for his politics, and especially what has happened to our city on his watch, there is more than enough there to do so. Like his excuses for running off ICE from the courthouse, we don't want him to be scared of going to the free clinic should the need arise! LOL!~

Boring clichéd comment....
I wasn't blaming obama for this one incident. I'm blaming the media and national leaders for at times siding with the wrong side of the crowd in Fergusson MO and elsewhere. Sticking up for thugs with no respect for their country or city or society who don't really care about the lives they claim to care about but rather use it as a convenient excuse to loot and riot. These are the actions/inactions that are leading to police murders. This wasn't happening too often until the past few years.
"I find this new movement of trying to label oneself very interesting. When I was young, I looked almost exactly the same as Nicholas, very androgynous, but I was female.  I was so upset when anyone tried to label me (calling me a dyke, fag, queer, tom-boy, etc.). I wanted to avoid labels; I was a woman, and being a woman can mean a lot of different things. Now everyone is straining to come up with as many new labels as there are people. It's kind of sad, really, because I feel like it is trying to separate us rather than unite us. We are all human, we are all born on a continuum of male/female; your clothes, hair, makeup, mannerisms, etc. do not make you male or female. Your DNA, hormones, gene expression, is unique for each person, but it doesn't make each person a new species. A man with long hair and makeup is not a woman, a woman with short hair and jeans is not a man. They are what they are, and that should be OK. It should be enough. I would prefer just one label, ""human."""

"Good suggestions. Let me add two comments.

First,  Oxycontin is not ""long-acting."" It has ""delayed absorption."" The medication itself (oxycodone) is no more long-acting in this formulation than in any other. This has practical importance. Once the medication is fully absorbed, it will be eliminated at a more rapid rate than a truly long-acting medication. In other words, it appears to be long-acting up to the point of full absorption (and time to full absorption varies a lot), and then it becomes shorter acting. The result is a more rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms, including hyperalgesia, and greater addictive potential than with a teuly long acting drug.

Second point is that if lower doses are better for many patients, then what about the lowest dose? The lowest risks of constipation, sedation, overdose, addiction and other problems are when opioid drugs are avoided entirely. Learning how to do so in practice, whenever possible, should be the top priority in ending this epidemic."

"There are two parallel discussions taking place.

One involves people who have read the document, the footnotes, the dubia, and the various positions taken by prelates and others. They take the topic seriously and are engaged in a serious discussion.  Some, like the author of the article Ms. Zagano, wish to man the barricades against the four cardinals. Others wonder aloud why the Holy Father does not do his job and what Footnote 351 means.

The second discussion is taking place among the folks Shakespeare describes in Julius Caesar: “.... the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps  ....”.

While they demonstrate over and over they have not read the document, the footnotes, the dubia, and the various positions taken by prelates and others, they do make a great deal of noise telling “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.”

Pay them no attention."

"""I still recommend taking out the North Korean missiles, nuclear weapons and leadership but use conventional weapons. An FAE and a few bunker busters would work.""

I'm sure that's been considered, but there are problems or it would have already been done. For one, Seoul would likely be turned into a sea of fire from the roughly 20 thousand artillery pieces targeting it. A whole lot of unhappy and dead Southerners the result. For another, China would likely go ape with unknown consequences. And then there's the likely possibility that you don't get all the nukes and/or the brain-trust that builds them( are you also prepared for an all out invasion of the North too track them down?). Too many things to go wrong in  a high risk action for relatively little gain. Better to work on striking a deal of some kind, like say a final peace treaty."

"I am not sure what the problem is

During the last low - dollar high tax rate differential with the USA (under Chretien), the country lost somewhere around 300,000 professionals.

This accomplishes two things - it leaves behind a greater percentage of the population that is employed by governments at all levels, which ensures the re-election of governments who favour these classes.

In addition, it creates a new field of work for these bureaucrats - creating soft programs like billboards in Silicon Valley trying to lure back the same people who where driven out by these programs....

"Perhaps I should rephrase:

I do care what God is doing in the world.  I believe that God is active in the Protestant sects. I believe that the fullest avenue of God's activity and the most perfect avenue of God's activity is in the Catholic Church.

If I thought it was in a Protestant sect, I would join that sect.  While I grant that the Protestants are our brothers and sisters in Christ, albeit separated brethren, I believe there are some things they got wrong.  In the end, however, I am not a Protestant, I am a Catholic. For that reason I don't particularly care what practices Protestants have or what is going on or not going on in their respective sects. That is their business--just as what goes on in the Catholic Church is our business.  In short--I mind my business when it comes to the Protestants. If they want to ordain women, that is their affair. If they think sacraments are not appropriate or believe we are saved by Faith alone, again, their business."
"I've been doing it for 35 years - bearing accountant's advice that my salary had to be justifiable, and the CRA never gave us any grief about it. One difference over the years has been that there are now a lot more (highly priced) seminars on how to decrease taxes through various means on the greyer shade than we or our accountant (and probably you) would be comfortable with. On the CBC site there were some suggested tweaks.  One of them was that businesses had to have a certain number of employees threshold, which makes sense.  The problem isn't so much actual small businesses who contribute to the economy but with individuals who incorporate simply to avoid paying taxes. 
The messaging on this was very bad.  Whoever thought it would be a good idea to scapegoat doctors, who do have offices, staff, expenses, like any small business, should be sentenced to a week in the hospital."

The Parish Council invite candidates for interview, short list a few and invite them each to do a weekend in the parish, saying Mass, hearing confessions and preaching. Then the parishioners vote on who they want and offer her 😉 the position. It would put an end overnight to the little Hitler syndrome as described above.

"One of the most pervasive myths about Trump is that he's a brilliant businessman. He isn't. It's a man that started at third base while the real estate market hit a homer, convinced himself it was his brilliance, and STILL barely managed to escape financial ruin many times, only by the deft of his bankruptcy attorneys. 

Four massive bankruptcies, hundreds of lawsuits by unpaid contractors, creditors, and labor groups, his real liquid income hidden under an abyss of real estate vehicles. Strip away his daddy's cash and his army of attorneys, and you have just an angry old white man that would probably be buying up gold bullion and gold-plated commemorative coins if not for his east coast pedigree. 

The only thing that stands out more than Trump's poor temperament, is his astonishing business stupidity. Especially given he started with $200 million from his old man in the 1970s (which today would be closer to $700 or $800 million), which he still managed to lose several times over."

1) All of that sounds very hard, no question.
2) In terms of real estate, young people today would gladly trade today's high prices/low rate environment for the high rates/lower multiple of income pricing of the 1980s. Why? Because if you scrimped and saved back then, you slowly got a bigger % of a down payment. Today the opposite is true - each year you sacrifice, you fall further behind. The math is shocking.

We too have moved. A full year of mat leave, while available, is simply not an option in some fast-moving professions. And given that a far larger % of employment is contract or temporary, this benefit doesn't exist. Salaries have continued to go nowhere for decades compared to a skyrocketing cost of living, so that problem you faced has only grown more pronounced.

None of this is to minimize the big challenges you faced. But it is possible that things are systematically harder today. It's all relative."

There are no good options with respect to a lunatic fascist, Kim, who has WMDs and missiles.

SK & Japan can defend themselves well with ABM systems; NK artillery can be neutralized.

A nuke in a container (which can be defended) is better than 200 NK ICBMs and NK transferring WMDs to Syria & Iran.

"Part of me wonders if most Catholics even care how the bishops are branded these days.  I think many have put a distance between these guys and themselves precisely nbecause their antics have embarrassed or even shamed many Catholics.  What is there possibly to be proud of in the way the bishops have handled the scandal?  When Cdl. Dolan recently set up that new program in his archdiocese to pay victims, did most of us rejoice, or did we sigh, and presume the program was to be yet one more round of  traps designed to shut victims up without holding anybody accountable for what happened to them?

How many Catholics truly CARE what these guys say on human sexuality anymore?  They haven't listened to us for decades...

The point is that the bishops have become their own caste, separate from us,, above us, and oblivious to us.  In that context, why would branding/rebranding even matter to most of us?"

Second, after immigration to Canada, a person must stay in Canada for two years out of five, or they lose status.  To get citizenship, you now need to be in Canada for three years out of five.  There is no escaping the rules anymore, now that the eTA system is in place.

Canada did not encourage United States to undermine international law to remedy their threat assessment. The 10.5 million is owed because Canadian official questioned Omar Khadr in Guantanamo?

"Very interesting information. I agree with what Raheel is saying. While she doesn't focus on it, her figures show that 0.03% of Muslims are violent Jihadis. I'd classify that as ""statistically few"".

This extrapolates to about 300 Canadian Muslims out of the over 1 million Muslims living in Canada. However even though there is no data for Canada in her video, when one looks at the statistics shown, there is a noticeably lower rate of fundamentalism in western countries compared to Muslim majority nations. Therefore the number of violent radical Muslims in Canada is very likely much less than 300.

Raheel's overall point is a serious concern about radical fundamentalists, not about Muslims as a whole. Reacting as if all Muslims are somehow bent on the destruction of the western world is  clearly unfounded."

"Walker also paid his friend (see: Alaska Gov. Walker's administration signs $275-an-hour contract with former attorney general)  to come up with a plan to use our permanent fund to buy and sell oil tax credits.  The plan would enable small oil companies who pay no tax to sell tax credits to larger companies so they could pay no tax.

"I think we simplify why people cling to religious identity. In Africa, the ones who didn't have a strong religious identity were converted by the European colonizers. The Muslim population stuck to religion as an identity (nationalism came in much later, and is an amorphous concept). 

The ones who stick to their religion don't integrate, or more importantly get a modern education. That begins a vicious circle of social immobility, and sticking to religion. However, looking down on someone's religion does not make them less religious. Accepting them does. India, for instance, allows religious laws to apply for marriage and inheritance, if a Muslim chooses to (there are civil laws, which apply according to ones choice). 

Along with the vote, that is a large reason that ISIS has more members from most western countries, despite India having 180 million Muslims (France has 5 million Muslims, and over 1000 members in ISIS, India has 60; Canada has over 100, USA has over 300)."

If Alaska's hydrocarbons was treated like a modern garbage dump it would be a huge improvement over how BigOil is managing our state resources as ""producers"".

Waste Management Inc. is America's largest garbage company, and they use plasma gasifiers to immolate the trash to produce a big profit from SYNGAS. The syngas is made into LNG for fleet fuels for garbage trucks, and the surplus gas is sold off to the power-grid.

">...the net cost to the state of the Juneau-Katzehin road is $193 million more than the cost of maintaining existing ferry service over the 36-year life of the project.<

It's really hard to take the State of Alaska's budget crisis seriously when the Walker administration threatens to perform resuscitation on this dead end project. I'd rather see the meager funds we'll have after our fiscal woes have bottomed out be spent on maintaining current, aging infrastructure. And frankly, I'd much rather ride a ferry down Lynn Canal than drive. Considering the possibility for avalanches and rockfalls to name but a couple of hazards the ferry will be by far, much safer."

If they appear to have been influenced by doing something done or heard, it's only because they were going to do that anyway.

There are places in Texas that get free electricity at night because there is a glut of wind power that can't be stored at present.  That, too, will change as storage technology improves.  But in the meantime our modern world is dependant upon fossil fuels.  That is reality and all the blathering in the world won't change it."

"""After the federal government introduced Bill C-56 in late June that would restrict how long inmates can be placed in solitary confinement...""

That statement is incorrect. Bill C-56 does NOT restrict how long a prisoner may be kept in solitary confinement. This includes younger offenders and prisoners with mental health issues. Bill C-56 simply requires that the warden who sends the prisoner to solitary confinement shall file a report on the matter after 15 days. After that, there's no limit to the amount of time a prisoner may be kept in isolation.

I stopped at the cockpit door and advised the captain that I had booked and paid for mt seat seven months earlier, I then advised the captain that I wanted my checked bags and informed the RCMP officer that if the aircraft was moved with my bags on board the captain and co-pilot were to be charged with theft and I then stepped off the aircraft. It took about 10 seconds for an apology to be issued and I was offered a seat in first class . I have not flown on Air Canada since and will never fly with them again."

There were probably extenuating circumstances.
HART's latest projections are still incomplete and incorrect.  They do not include the city- required $35 million of reserves for the G.O. bonds.  Bond proceeds appear to be incorrect -- they're listed at $390 when only $350 was approved by council.  Other revenue shown at $7 million is actually lower than audited amounts.  The legislature should not pass any tax extension or increase.
and you are the king who decides everything? too funny.
"TOD and other development that would be encouraged on the rail line is another example of ""bait and switch.""  The final environmental impact statement for rail says that the character of the land along the rail line will not be substantially changed.  The ""bait and switch"" indicates that transportation is secondary for the rail project.  Rail's primary purpose is to make money for big landowners, developers, construction companies, banks and other financial institutions, unions, and politicians."
"Chris, I disagree; this will change nothing. The Catholic clergy are already roughly 50% homosexual, and the proportion is probably increasing. Just as 98% of Catholic couples use contraceptives despite the unambiguous ban of Humanae Vitae, so to this ambiguous repetition of a former ambiguous statement will change nothing in the practice of accepting gays into the priesthood. 

But of course you are right, if gays were actually banned, our seminaries would be very much ""emptier"" than they are now."

"This is an enjoyable read, however:
It's easy, & far too common, to look back at history & criticize actions taken, which seem egregious by today's standards. But agonizing over past events which would not likely take place today serves no useful purpose - rather it tends to polarize different racial/cultural groups.
Times & acceptable behavior of nations & individuals change.
Cultures change as the times demand. No viable cultures are static, dynamism is required to adapt to the world as it, too, inevitably changes.
Clearly the technological advantages of the ""western societies & nations"" led them to gain land and influence, while the cultures less advanced in weaponry, organization, etc. lost many battles, land, & influence through ""cultural default""."

and if you tot up the total homicides in 2015 (more recent data!) you get 13,455 of which 9,616 are from firearms, which is actually up over 70% of the total.  So Nohman... not sure what you're looking at.

"It's predictable that most of the comments would be from men (who could use a dollbot or two) sneering at women, or from women (who are sick of the men going after them instead of the dollbots) sneering at men.  Most of the dollbots in the discussion are fake-female, either way.

But the first s.f. to deal with human/robotic copulation I ever came across, three or more decades ago, Asimov's Robots of Dawn, had a woman cohabit with an anatomically correct male robot.

I think both sexes would benefit equally if they had access to dollbots, whatever preference they may choose to add to the acronym."

"To tell you the truth Bill, I don't think there is any excuse for a man forcing himself on a woman that isn't willing.  Same goes for a powerful woman forcing herself on a man.  Period.

I'm just saying that women are more sexually adventuresome than 'society' is ready to accept publicly,(especially those over 50).   Birth control has lessened concern for pregnancy, and woman seek social power in ways that weren't common 50 years ago.  So why Wouldn't they use sex to achieve power/status?     There's a female Weinstein out there.

Moving toward gender equality has not been easy.  It's important that people be truthful with each other.   It's important people feel 'safe' if you want the truth.  Fewer threats and accusations would help men and women feel safer to talk honestly."
"When is a costume, or a participation in a festival, not a cultural expropriation? Is there any costume, or participation in any festival, that is not a cultural expropriation? Why stop at other racial, ethnic, language, or religious groupings? Ms. Renzetti does not provide any framework for answering these questions.

A 65 year old international traveler is invited by local people to dress up in their costumes. She feels uncomfortable. Is this cultural expropriation? A 13 year old birthday party centres on eight girls dressing up in 1980's fashion, and going out to eat together. Is this cultural expropriation? Is a man cross dressing in women's clothes cultural expropriation? Is miming or dressing up as harlequin cultural expropriation? A small boy love dressing up as a sailor. None of this is clear in Ms. Renzetti's fuzzy framework.

And, is dressing up as a dinosaur an expropriation of the interests of another species, or another statement of Humans at the top of the living scale?"

Comment:  Compacts(aka contracts)  are to be enterpeted not by modern language, but by the language (words and the definitions of those words) at the time of the writing of the document.

Just because within a living language we create new words, does not mean to reject the old.

A 55 gallon drum is not an option as it would be too heavy to pick up and dump and the garbage men are certainly not going to loosen a bolt on the lock ring to dump the barrel. I'm assuming you are using that as an example of how to store your trash outside which is a good idea if you don't have a garage. 

The real problem is there are too many bears in residential areas period. It's getting to the point where now people are criticized for their audacity to expect to have their trash picked up curbside because bears get into it. If it is hard for people to throw their trash away curbside the trash will then spills out into the vacant lots and woods.

To now suggest Oregon lost to a Top 10 team is typical rah rah small town journalism. The Ducks have played against ONE ranked team this season...UW. Oregon could also go through the season with only ONE game(UW) against a ranked team on their schedule...at the time Oregon played them.

"I'm a professional (physician). In the process of unincorporating. There is a lot of exaggeration on both sides. I have done some pretty careful calculations....I save about $3000 - $5000/year via incorporation. I also pay ~$2500 extra in accounting/legal fees. The people who really lose on these changes are very high-priced specialists who income split with young adult children and a say-at-home spouse as well as the lawyers and accountants who have been carrying out the various schemes. Most primary care physicians will be surprised at how little they are impacted....While I do think some federal bureaucrats need a reality check (and changes to) their bloated benefits/pensions, physicians still have RRSPs, RESPS, TFSAs...one can save ~$36 000 a year using these, which if invested smartly e.g. ETFs will generate a very comfortable retirement and education paid that most Canadians don't enjoy....and if one still insists on a private corporation, there are still personal pension plans."
"I agree that the definition of what constitutes a hate is unclear and either needs to be refined or scrapped. I do understand the motivation. We as a nation, have yet to address our history of racism and it consequences. From black slavery to the genocidal policies against native Americans, to the past and current nativist movements, we have record of racist oppression that hasn't been openly and fairly discussed with a view to some kind of national resolution. Incidents such as this, the Travon Martin shooting, Rodney King, the history of lynching, all are symptomatic of the endemic racism of our country, and will continue to happen until we as a nation face up to and resolve our past."

"<<Despite Trump's supposed gay positive stance,>>
The problem with Trump -- and this is a difficulty for those who purport to support him almost as much as it is for those who don't -- is that he has no intellectual center, no moral principles, no political philosophy, no convictions or beliefs to guide his thinking, no anchor or rudder by which to form policy positions or to adopt stances.  Nothing he says has any meaning or value beyond the moment in which he says it.  And so your observation about the reactionary government he is forming is right on point."

The Mainland Hotel Corporations need their $200 to $1000 per night charges for a concrete box so they can make big Profits for their Investors, Stock Holders while basically f__king the Locals.

At Many Modern 21st Century European Nations their Governments like Bed and Breakfasts as usually a Mom and Pop Operation of ""Empty Nesters"" that have a Limited Fixed Income, because they can by having a Bed and Breakfast make enough money to pay their Taxes, Property Taxes, and not become a burden by getting kicked out of their Homes of Generations, and becoming Homeless like at Demonrats Hawaii."

"I resented being forced to be one of the guinea pigs for equality as a member of the military,  I also resented my loss of Free Speech, Freedom of Association and several other Constitutional rights.

That's where the progressives get to force their views on a portion of the society just because they can.

As a result, however, the goals of a meritocracy which did not depend of 'affirmative action' or 'special' treatment based on race permitted and required me to be an equal, a subordinate and a supervisor of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and every other conceivable ethnic group.  

If you do that for twenty years or so, and pay any kind of attention, and the meritocracy actually functions most of the time, (nothing human-designed is perfect!) your attitudes will change.

I found, based on personal experience, that every single human being's best and worst qualities exist in every single ethnic group without exception.  They are not weighted more heavily in any particular one, either."
"Says someone who really doesn't understand the industry. You do realize bitumen is going down the TransMountain today? Albeit in smaller batches. And it is either Dilbit, Synbit, or SCO (synthetic crude oil)? Along with diesels, gasolines, and jet fuel?

You do understand a new refinery/upgrader is under construction and is due to come on line this year after having been initiated by the former Progressive Conservative government? You do understand that the economics of building new refineries/upgraders are weak and that new Oil Sands mines (Kearl, Fort Hills) are producing pipeline spec bitumen that doesn't require upgrading using a new process called paraffinic froth treatment?

You do understand that there isn't much difference between a dilbit, synbit ocean spill and conventional oil?

You do understand that bitumen isn't any more corrosive during transportation than crude oil or refined petroleum products?"

"At least some German prelates are proceeding in Christ's light, as Francis has advised.  The pastoral approach of Francis has two advantages.  

First, it is a practical work-around to the Pharisaical preoccupation with legal formulations that has gripped the institutional Church in matters related to marriage and the family.

Second, a pastoral focus gives breathing room for people to center themselves on the Spirit of Christ in their hearts.  This centering moves toward the reign of God that Jesus preached.

Muller and the four cardinals don't appreciate how much distance there is from the Church when a person struggling to discern their conscience cannot be confident that a pastor will encourage that discernment.  Francis is encouraging that discernment.

And, in the end, that discernment restores the primacy of the great commandments to love God and neighbor.  Lack of ""exceptions"" to a subordinate principle -- such as indissolubility -- risks denying the primacy of love."

"Well, I beg to differ, create a forward presence of always on station Aegis equipped ships with the eventual upgraded SM missile that can take out ICBMs in the Sea of Japan off NK. next ask the Japanese with their eventual Aegis on-shore batteries to help if the trajectory is Hawaii, then base the same Aegis and SM equipped ships off of Hawaii, install new tracking and prosecuting radars in Hawaii, activate the on-shore Aegis and SM site at Barking Sands, then beef-up the GBI sites in Alaska and California with more missiles to protect Hawaii, so they can take multiple ripple shots at any in-bound missile or warheads.  If that is not enough to reduce the threat of leak-through to an impossibly low percentage, then rinse and repeat, by beefing up more of the same.  Spending a couple billion dollars to do this to protect just the irreplaceable military infrastructure of at least equal value, makes sense.

"I agree that KYC means a financial advisor is basically hamstrung and has to suggest GIC's here.  The problem with KYC is that when people are unsophisticated, as this couple is, it leads to horrible choices (like putting $300K in GIC's).  What these people really need is an education.

Right now all their income is from GIC's, pensions and annuities.  They are basically 100% invested in secure stuff.  They have $300K leftover, a long-term investment horizon (both mid 60's, so most likely 20 years) and need income.  Clearly, the best option here is dividend paying stocks.  

While they were burned by the Great Recession, the only reason they were burned is because they sold.  Again, showing a lack of understanding about risk.  Buy dividend stocks, earn more money than a GIC and on a tax-preferred basis.  And in 20 years you kids will have way more than $300K."

It worries me that we need the influence of faith based people to know how to live together, to not fall into traps of nationalism, which is tribalism writ larger.   All these faiths do teach us a basic respect for one another, of the God given humanity we all share.  But each faith wants to determine social rules that all must live by.

All accomplished through militant actions wiping out any other humans in their way.  Christianity is a creation using Judaism as a base by a 2nd Century Pope in collusion with a Roman Emperor to wipe out all other pagan religions for a more suitable male dictatorship reflected in a male god.  The Roman legions were used to carry out the conquests under the new banner of the male christian god.  All of the current male god religions, Judaism, christianity, and Islam are based on the Judaic creation story of Adam and Eve and their tyrannical god.  The world has suffered ever since.

The idea of not selling pot and weed in the same store is laughable. What is the distance to be between the two? A city block, cab ride? And what about the clear reality that they will eventually end up in the same house regardless.
Glad it happened but the method is madness."
"Hi beachbum11, 

Just thought if by chance you haven't seen the movie I've been referencing in several posts here, then this is the link to the relevant scene:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RUBaRqY_NqA

To repeat what I wrote, there ain't no arguing with physics, which in this scenario has everything to do with the definition of inertia. 

Oh, and by the way, by somewhat eerie coincidence, the movie ""Fearless"" is very much based upon the actual DC-10 crash into a cornfield at Sioux City, Iowa on July 19, 1989.  The crash scene is widely regarded as one of the ten most realistic depictions of a passenger jet crash ever filmed.

I said ""eerie coincidence"" just now.  Why?  Because the actual jet that crashed in 1989 was UNITED AIRLINES Flight 232 en route from Denver to Chicago. 

Again, if you haven't yet done so, borrow, rent or download the flick.  It's that good. 

Cheers!"
"Immigrants, sure!  300,000++ a year, sure!  But we are taking more than that, and we are taking a disproportionate number from one place, China.  Each available house in our neighbourhood recently snapped up by people from one place.   Vacant houses also more evident .  Prices at crazy levels despite a weak economy.....  How many of these people are ""undocumented immigrants?""  In on those stupid multiyear visas?  What are the ACTUAL numbers we are taking in each year, from each country, INCLUDING ""visa visitors"" who will be here forever?  Maybe the Globe could do something useful and report on that, since the government hides the truth.    We need to take people by skills, not money and donations to the Liberals.  Stop the unlimited visas, limit property to citizens (grandfather prior purchases, if you must).  Let it be known you will enforce tax on worldwide income, tax the vacancies hard, and scrap dual citizenship.  The take MORE from Africa, and the r.o. the world, too!"

"Didn't really look for it.  Like I said, my point isn't that the law is unconstitutional, but rather that arguing that voluntarily compliance trumps constitutionality is flawed.

Regardless, the case isn't really dispositive.  It lays a good foundation for the argument in support of the constitutionality, but it's focused on the actions of a political party in selecting candidates in a primary.  The lack of state action is critical to its decision.  There's a pretty fundamental difference between a political party saying ""we won't put you on the ballot unless you promise to vote a certain way"" and a state government saying ""we're going to engage in criminal prosecution if you don't vote a certain way."""
"The fact that the ""religious liberty"" crowd never uttered a word of disapproval when Donald Trump declared that he wants a moratorium on all Muslims entering the country revealed their rank hypocrisy. Anyone who's genuinely concerned about the preservation of religious freedom would have been appalled at such a statement, Catholics especially, since there was a time in this country when ""No Catholics need apply"" signs were rampant. What the religious liberty folks really mean when they talk about religious liberty is freedom to practice MY religion the way I see fit at everyone else's expense. That's not religious liberty, it's just plain old selfishness.

Muslims are justified in their worry about a Donald Trump presidency - he gave them every reason to be afraid - very afraid."

"Read this quote from the very story on which you are commenting. The quote can also be found in the OP's comment to which I replied. “Because you’re basically taking away a constitutional right to freedom of speech,” he told reporters. I am at a loss to explain how you could miss such a clear clue, but perhaps facts are less important to you than an agenda?

3.  A GST cut increased disposable income and ultimately more NGO jobs.  The question, was it great enough to increase tax revenue to offset the GST revenue loss.  What so many economists do not understand, (on both sides) -- Tax increases do affect NGO jobs, AND Tax decreases do not create as many jobs as predicted and there is time delay on tax decreases."

"C.S.  let me respond with my post responding to LenG: ""

LenG: May I offer agreement. None of our Constitutional rights are ""absolute."" The limitations on the First Amendment are the clearest example. As you suggest, limitations on the lethality of firearms could easily be enacted. However, it's important to recognize that the firearms industry/NRA lobbying power continues to block any such efforts at the national level.

"No they're not, with the possible exception of the victim. Marijuana possession should never have been a crime. Of the attackers, one was housed and two apparently homeless. There are violent people among both the housed and homeless, and they're a minority in both cases. I know of no evidence that homeless people are more violent than housed. A few news stories don't prove anything.

On the other hand, the homeless are very vulnerable to attack, from both housed & homeless, since they have no locked doors to protect them. Especially women, who I've heard are ""terrified"". They are also in danger from disease, due to exposure to the weather and lack off medical care, and die much younger than the housed."

They have a right to make their statements. They did this two years ago. Their pastor and bishop did not see it their way. There is a canonical procedure they can follow, although with the picayune complaints I cannot imagine them getting what they apparently wish.

Instead of building Site C, Hydro should use the power that BC is entitled to under the Columbia River treaty - over 1,100 MW capacity and 4,000 GWh/yr energy.  But the BC Liberals won't allow it, so instead this power is sold on the market for $30 a MWh, one-third the cost of Site C's energy.

And BC now has smart meters which would allow time-of-use billing to reduce peak loads, further negating the need for Site C.  But the Liberals won't let Hydro take advantage of that either.  

Hydro's debt is spiraling out of control - despite a 46% rate increase from 2014 to 2024, Hydro's debt will grow from $16 billion to $24 billion over the same period.  Clearly not sustainable."

- One shelter evicted all of their families to comply with the new rules, and now only has singles in the shelter. Where there was once over 100 kids in that shelter with their families (close to 300 people), there are now just over 100 people total.

What a way to burn money. If the Federal government simply bought the art outright, it would pay no rent and, after ten years, would be saving money every year forward, indeed saving the price of the piece every ten years.

That is what most private businesses do that want art on display, they buy it. But then private businesses do not have an endless supply of taxpayer money to burn..."

Except if in the UK or Ireland where English is the main language or Scandinavian Countries or Netherlands where virtually everyone speaks English, make an effort to speak a few words of the local language and if you cannot always ask if the person speaks English before speaking unless on their name tag it shows they do.  While English is widely spoken as a second language in Europe, not everyone speaks it and unlike the US most Europeans take pride in knowing multiple languages so even if they speak English at least making an effort is appreciated which I find Brits often do but not Canadians and Americans."

These are the same people that disrupted the meeting of world conservationist earlier this year.  Money, money, money....  Where is the courage, justice, good, moderate. pious and virtuous board.   They are slavers and violators of state and federal law.  Trump will order the unlawful fisherman deported.

"The Burmese authorities know what is best for Burma.

Why do Lloyd Axworthy and Allan Rock meddle in the affairs of Burma? Who gave them the right to do so? The era of gunboat diplomacy was over years ago. Meddling by westerners only aggravate problems and create new problems, e.g. Libya, Iraq,

Would Canadian politicians and the putative ‘elite’ appreciate Burmese (or Chinese) authorities reprimand Canada for its abysmal treatment of Indigenous people?"
Wonderful job guys!
Thank you Sam for a little perspective. I love how people are so quick to compare their petty little actions as war.
"MY,  You are right:  ""Oregon, Iowa and Vermont – Distributors Keep Unclaimed Deposits"".  Check-out this website:  http://www.bottlebill.org/about/unclaimed.htm

While Oregon's Bottle Bill lead the nation at one time, atrophy has set in.  As the above website shows, there are things that can be done to strengthen and improve it but that would require politicians to do more than figure out how to be elected and re-elected."

"I agree with half of that but Walker has not been fiscally responsible with the state's money.  He has hired unnecessary executives with super salaries, opened $10 Million marketing offices in Texas and Japan.  

He used state money to hire a political consultant for his next campaign running as a Republican in the Democratic party again.  Looks like Democrats are stuck with him again running against an even worse Republican.  Wonderful.  How is that even fair?  Get out of our party!    

When Walker came into office, he admitted SB21 was a failure.  He stated for the first time in state history we are making less than zero on our oil.

Instead of raising awareness and lobbying for change, Walker traveled the state pushing for an income tax and theft of our PFD, the exact opposite of what he promised before he was elected.

What we should be discussing right now is how to get our fair share of oil revenue. If we were taking our fair share of 1/3=+$3 Billion...there would be no crisis."

"Hello Thomas McGee!

You are wrong. The CBC has NOT reported the connection between high Vancouver house prices and waves of overseas money arriving from China.`

Did you even read the articles you posted? They do not pin, on money from China, the fact that Vancouver house prices have skyrocketed to dozens of times the average annual local income and, further, they make the false claim that, even if money from China had hypothetically been the cause, no policy could have stopped it.

Are you somehow unaware of the difference between money from China and foreign owners? Let me school you. Those ""foreign investors"" and ""foreign buyers"", the focus of the CBC's articles, do not hold Canadian passports. They are a tiny force: The HUGE force, UNMENTIONED by the CBC,  are buyers of Canadian passports (investor immigrant programs) and stand-in shills covering up for foreigners. That huge group is not accounted for in talk of ""foreign investors"". So no, the CBC has not reported what you claim."
"I just don't believe that nature and the cosmos needed a guiding hand - happenstance and accident are far more likely the reason we are here (and that's without getting into the multiverse concept expounded in Quantum Theory) than some all powerful being that created a universe so vast we can't envision how truly big it is, yet he personally cares for me, to the extent that he observes my sex life and will cast me into a lake of fire for doing things wrong, according to him. It just makes no logical sense to me. 

As for morals, you don't need religion to have morals - those too are concepts that any rational intelligence could mostly agree on.

You say I will meet god one day - well that's great, I'll ask him the same question Stephen Fry said he would ask, if confronted by god: ""Bone cancer in children - what's that about?""

But hey, each to his own - I know many religious people who are truly wonderful human beings, apart from that weird quirk of believing in a magical sky fairy."
That's acute reaction!

Unfortunately, as one of the volunteers, I can attest to the fact that it's always a struggle to get enough volunteers to support even the current arrangement. Raising the cutoff to 35 or 40 degrees would dramatically increase the number of nights for which coverage is needed and there just aren't enough resources to support that."

"""Trudeau won't live to see a balanced budget""
There are many factors that could see a balanced budget sooner than you think.  
First is the effect of the infrastructure investment bank.  No financial model has taken that into effect as no-one knows how to estimate its effect.  
Second, overhauling the tax system could increase revenues, especially if it moves toward taxing consumption rather than income.  
Third, taxing the capital gains on primary residences could be implemented so that those flipping residences, after a year or two, for profit would pay tax while those living in their primary residence for many years would not.  
Fourth, the government could reign in spending.  
Being in deficit until 2050 assumes no changes to taxes and no changes to spending."
"If traveling on a two lane road, doing the posted speed limit, why should I have to pull over to yield to 5 or more vehicles behind me...delaying my trip and wasting fuel through slowing down and/or stopping?

"No one believes in pure, unregulated capitalism.  For example, who doesn't believe that the FDA shouldn't regulate the pharmaceutical industry, and what executive of a pharma company is going to take the pills of a new drug that has not gone through the US drug approval process?

"Isn't it great that through the game of football they are now interested in getting involved in something worth caring about?

"Canadians need self preservation from all the smugglers to Canada and all the immigration scams. We should no longer be paying any legal fees for any illegal immigrant, nor their translation fees. It should be known world-wide that you have to be able to speak the language here and apply through the proper channels and pay that department to enter Canada, not random smugglers and then come here to get ""free"" this and that."
"What is so amusing about this process, is how quickly it has happened (a relative term). With the Tax Queen's approval ratings in the toilet and an unhappy party, her renewed sense of urgency is, well, surprising.

Saying that, she still should resign. Her province would love her for it."

"One of the biggest problems with bears, is that they are big and tough.  The handguns most people carry will truly just piss a bear off, 9mm, .40, .45, none are big enough to stop a bear unless you are incredibly lucky.  Something larger, the problem is getting your follow on shots on target.  In rifle calibers, most hunters that I know, use bolt action rifles, so you might get 1 or at most 2 shots at a charging bear, and even with a .30 cal round (30-30, 30-06, .308), you may or may not stop the bear in the first shot.  One of the articles pointed out that it took an average of 4 shots to stop a bear, unless you are incredibly lucky or very very good, you aren't going to get the chance at 4 shots.

You would have a better chance against a black bear than against a grizzly, just because black bears tend to be smaller and less aggressive.  That being said, the right tool is bear spray."
"President Manbaby is as dense as a lead balloon, or are you in favor of a ""joint cybersecurity task force"" with Russia?

"There is one simple, obvious and humane solution to the migrant problem across the Mediterranean. For every migrant boat arriving in Europe or discovered en route: 

1. Remove all migrants from the boat along with the paid smuggler captains, and then permanently confiscate or sink the boat.

2. Immediately and safely transport every person back to their port of departure and drop them off. Let them know if they try again they will experience the exact same result.

This policy will immediately send the message to everybody that paying a smuggler and attempting passage is a total waste of time and money that will accomplish nothing. The smugglers will quickly go out of business and the boats will stop coming. People will stop dying on the high seas tragically. Europe will reduce the migrant crisis that it already cannot afford economically or socially. This is the humane solution."

"Taqiyya is the Islamic practice of deception. It can take the form of concealing the full truth (omission) or telling  non-believers only what they want to hear (concealment). Taqiyya is the Fifth Column of the Islamic Faith, and is to protect Allah, Muhammad and the Koran from skeptics and critics.Taqiyya is as basic to Islam as charity is to Christianity.  No other religion has such a thing as Taqiyya. It is anathema to all other religions. It is hard for non-Muslims to understand that it actually exists and is used regularly to convince us that we are the problem, and they are the hapless victims. ."

"Well, you made me use google, always willing to learn something new. Anywho, ""Egalitarianism"" sounds real good but as an overall 'rule of thumb' will never work in America. It's a nice thought but the facts are simple, you work hard you get ahead, you sit on your hands you don't. From time to time you will fail, that's the price of life in a country where you are allowed to 'rise to the top' or fail depending on what you are willing to put into your future. At no time should we be looking to just GIVE people everything they want or think they need. I have yet to see 'unbridled greed and ruthlessness' in America."

""Global warming is a hoax: [report by oil firms.""]

Agreed. Joseph Card. Ratzinger with the approval of  then Pope John Paul II wrote and promulgated something quite different.  This contemporary position MUST be repudiated. I see the point made so ably by Dennis Galon and agree with the difficult process of change within this beast.  The repudiation of the contemporary JPII/Ratzinger literalism of Genesis rationalizes and justifies diminution and exclusion of women.

And moving beyond 'morality is relative to culture' its pretty easy to see that the morality of a bunch of camel herders in an arid climate is necessarily different to the morality of a bunch of peasant farmers in a harsh c0ld and wet climate.

When Zuma says that 'Corruption is a Western thing' He is precisely right: It is. In his culture and world-view, the absence of socialism and welfare means putting self first, family second, and tribe third.  That is simply survival.

Only a culture that has evolved out of a monumental dependence on trade and business ethics, comes to condemn corruption as 'bad for business'.

In South Africa, we see the conflict between cultures: On the one hand everyone wants the advantages of technological civilisation, but no one wants to pay the ultimate price in adapting their culture to what is necessary for it to function."
"Exactly. We currently have a government imposed education ceiling. That's one of the best lines I've ever heard supporting education choice! 

If you can only afford to live in Mt View or Airport Heights your kids are sentenced to their low-performing government assigned school with no other choices. In those schools, you have a 60-70% chance your kid will not read or do math at grade level and will do poorly after they leave elementary school.  Those schools have ZERO incentive to innovate or improve because they know the kids and the dollars they represent will return every year regardless of performance-- they don't have any other choice.

AA is about living life on lifes terms, life sometimes sucks but AA folks learn to deal with life without relying on substances to alter their brains. I find alcohol and drugs of any kind to be in the same boat, a person uses to deal with the inability of dealing with the reality of life.

Thus, Bernie could have run as an Independent, and if he didn't win nationally, his votes could have gone to the Democrats.

I usually don't blame the candidates though. The system forces them to grab for tons of cash by not saying some things and pandering around saying things they may not really believe. Not many people would go through the national election process. Look at the intense scrutiny that they have to endure, and look at the danger that they have to face every day. They are brave to run. The fault truly lies in the system, not the candidates. As a country we are them.

Wait till your businesses assets are threatened with expropriation without compensation and then let’s see how commentators (like Ruth Hall) feel? Not that she runs a for-profit enterprise.

Note how the FBI seems to think that the media and locals of Burns are the problem not the ""occupation"".

As far as cyclists being especially vulnerable, when all things are considered, being in a car is equally dangerous as being on a bike on a per hour basis, and much more dangerous from the standpoint of traumatic brain injuries. Crashes can kill or maim no matter one's mode, but cyclists have better ability to avoid them than motorists. We all have an interest in safe roads, but for some reason many motorists resist the low-hanging fruit of removing dangerous drivers by increasing patrols."

"All Airbnb has to do is post notification on their website that many cities now require permitting for short term rentals.

It implies, if you rent a unit that doesn't include the permit, there is a possibility the rental could be shut down before you arrive. Put the onus on the buyer.

On another note, after some experience with Airbnb in our strata, we created a bylaw to deal with it and they were shut down. The most recent was actually a renter who was subletting to vacationers via Airbnb, while she stayed with her boyfriend."
"Once again Roy please read dnad understand;

“Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance.

"Wrong. Gross Negligence requires using a product in a manner not consistent with its intended use. Just because a product is illegal in Colorado doesn't mean that the use or possession of said item negligent enough to deny an insurance claim. These consumer fireworks are regulated under the Consumer Product Safety Act, the same act/code that insurers rely on when insuring said products. It would be pretty difficult for an insurance company to say a product, which has been deemed as 'safe and sane,' is suddenly now not safe or sane even though it was used in it's designed manner - so long as the policy owner didn't alter or manipulate the device. Colorado law is pretty clear on this one, and it would take extraordinary (legally speaking) language in the policy, with the burden on the insurer, to deny such a claim."

Even the illegals here mostly come for the opportunity to earn money to send home, which is very admirable.

"There are many tremendous business people who create thousands upon thousands of jobs in this country, they are leaders and they are respected.  However, they are not the CEOs of top 100 public companies.  I'm talking about entrepreneurs and visionaries that create new jobs in Canada.   
Most of those top 100 public company CEOs are vastly overpaid and supported by the cozy club that is other CEOs and director-types who appoint each other to cushy roles on boards.  Everyone is afraid to say NO.  It's like free agency with no salary cap.  Look at employment figures, it's not from the big PubCo's.
Finally, for the one CEO who can run, say a Canadian bank, there are many others within the same company who are just as capable and make far less.  Two of my close relatives were very high up in Canadian banks at one point, and some of the good stories, and stories of incompetence, are surprising and sad.

"""Predicting rail costs not a simple task""  OK, that's true.  But here's the thing....we're not talking about nickels and dimes.  We're talking BILLIONS of dollars!  If we're building a new building and the cost overrun is a half million dollars, I don't think we would even blink an eye.  But a project that was estimated at 3.2 billion is now projected to cost OVER 10 BILLION?  I would say that's some pretty poor predicting!  The other issue is that back when the idea was put out to vote, it was with the idea that it was going to cost 3.2 billion.  Those who voted YES all believed that.  How would it have turned out if it was stated that the cost would be over 10 billion?  Would we still have voted YES?  Or, was it a strategy (by PRP?) to UNDER estimate it just to get us to vote YES?  Hmmmmm!  The average voter is not a construction expert, so whatever they estimated we believed.  I am positive those in the industry knew it would cost a lot more than 3.2 billion!"

As a man you also have no right to make health care decisions for women and their families. Enjoy your God and let others enjoy theirs.

We need  to take a  closer look at average salaries of folks living in Canada's large cities could be more meaningful. (I also wonder how banks would confirm income of foreign buyers?)

Trump needs to drop the Taiwan bargaining chip as it is bringing out the bully in China it so carefully hides on the world scene and instead focus on duties and technology transfer bans. He may look to how China moves it currency offshore by buying foreign assets to protect them from its own currency devaluations. You can't sabre rattle with a mindset that builds its own island, in the middle of nowhere, to extend territorial claims.

As for China they are takers, if they were wise they would do to North Korea what they did to Nepal or are they afraid that NK will fight back? If they did Trump would hug them like Putin."

Rumour has it Lincoln wrote his immortal Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope but surely even the trust fund twins would agree that our tax system is rather more complex than the Gettysburg Address which was essentially poetry not prose.

The arrogance of this PM and his finance minister seems to know no bounds as evidenced by this rushed exercise in the most complex and sensitive area of government and its interface with citizens.

If a comprehensive and independent royal commission on taxation was required in those simpler tax days of 1966, it is even more required now instead of a partisan tax scavenger hunt."

if the police departments fear armed criminal activity to the point where they seek military grade weapons and vehicles to protect themselves, why do police departments, such as those in hawaii, deny citizens their constitutional rights to carry firearms to protect themselves and their families from the same armed criminal activity?
.
police jurisdictions that deny citizens the constitutional right to carry firearms should prove their point by patrolling without firearms."
"The war in Syria has been going on for over 7 years at a cost of hundred thousand of lives and total disruption of the population. Little has been done by the world up to now,and we have come to know that the UN is completely useless when it comes to conflicts like this. Obama's line in the sand meant nothing, and the recent gas attacks confirmed this. For those that would criticize Trump and the U.S. for their actions, what was the viable alternative, as after 7 years diplomacy was not and never was going to work. We could have course turned the page and said not our problem, but we have done that too many times in the past and we are supposed to be better then that.It was clear years ago as it is now,  Assad will have to go, either willingly or by other means. Trump has sent a message that has been heard very clearly by those in the Middle East , Russia, China, and North Korea, and the message has been understood."

"The core purpose of panamice.com is to form consortiums ... to refurbish, and add to, the total infrastructure of North, Central, and South America.  Rail-Roads, Interstates, Bridges, Tunnels, Power grids, Oil and Gas transport pipe-lines, Airports, sea-ports, and etc.  In addition, it will be self-supporting with smaller and varied projects, which will give its members experience at managing projects.  It will span generations.  Of Alaska interest, is to finish the Rail-Road through Canada, to North Pole, and to continue it to Nome, and also to Valdez.  Additionally, to build power-plants on the Slope, with HVDC down the West coast, the Rail-Belt, and through Delta to Valdez.  There are many parties wanting to do the same, but none of them have a big enough project to attract that kind of financing.  PANAMICE is embarking on a 60 (t)rillion project, spanning at least three decades.  The potential returns will be very tempting to Domestic, Chinese, Middle East, and other monies."

"Harper did nothing for 10 years nor did the Liberals the previous 9 years. Canada is transitioning its energy mix production and exports - however, a complete transformation will not happen over night and Rachel Notley is correct that we (Canada) needs royalties from fossil fuels to finance the transition to  a cleaner fuel production scheme. 
In the meantime the responsible thing to do is get the highest value for our product that gives all governments (Federal, Provincial and yes municipal) the best bang for the buck that also minimizes environment degradation. 
In this context - oil is going to find it's way to market one way or another. This means whether it is by existing and new pipelines or rail - its going to get there somehow. The argument to refine bitumen in Alberta for the ""value added"" proposition does not wash because the ROI is at least 30 years out. We are talking about not growing production past 2030... Pipelines are the only safe option. Lest we go by rail...."
"I'm confused, do you refer to the corporate Dems rush to the party's extreme right?

The Clintons destroyed welfare for the poor while making corporate welfare an entitlement and repealed Glass Steagal setting us up for the mess in 2008.

Her Wall Street goonage puts GOP flacks to shame whilst her neocon credentials have her viewing a nuclear first strike using the new superfuses as a strategy worth investigating.

Hillary wouldn't have had the leeway to present her candidacy without Democratic leadership complicit in her incompetence.  Now that her failure is enshrined in history, Dem leaders only complain Russia Russia Russia, all the while talking about a better deal.  My question is better for whom?"

How much is spent on athletics, extra curricular activities and what is the cost benefit of them?

Arbitration is extremely biased towards the corporations, because arbitrators make their living by being selected by the parties (it is not like a court where you just get assigned to a judge) - a typical consumer might go to arbitration once, while the corporation might have hundreds - you can only guess which side the arbitrator is likely to favor if they want repeat business.

The most you can do when the decision goes against you is appeal the arbitration decision, and that is almost a guaranteed loser in court because the court presumes the validity and binding nature of the arbitration process absent exceptional circumstances.

Everyone I know along the route says they will likely depart the city. Look at what it's done to Waterloo and Eglinton West in Toronto. Talk about how to kill a city in one fell swoop. But don't kid yourselves, this has been a back room done deal pretty much since day one. I expect when they break ground this September I will be forced to leave as well.

"Another POV on this is the fact that this type of news makes the current administration at Washington Place look good.

"During that 2 May 17 Senate testimony, several Senators asked him directly to say whether Trump was under investigation. Each time he weasel worded the answers…declining to give a straight answer based on some convoluted doublespeak.

Obviously, nothing really was a concern coz NOTHING was wrong. After all, all along, we were told how upright and righteous Comey was…

Comey even set his own precedent by acquiescing to Lynch’s request(?) that he call the Clinton email investigation, “The Clinton matter”.

Why didn’t he resign then?

Not even a year ago Brad Wall was loudly complaining about having to make transfer payments to provinces like Quebec. Now Brad Wall's own province is bankrupt.

Now, Brad Wall punishes low income people by cutting STC and libraries; he jacks service fees up to the sky. And he shows how unfair he is by making cuts which mostly affect people who are less likely to vote Sask Party.

This will generate a minor skirmish among those who read each other's comments and imagine that a billion-plus Catholics care. They don't.

"I have heard from some that Catholic Biblical scholarship is among the most advanced today, but it doesn't filter down to the laity.

      There are such riches in Scripture when read with the help of the Holy Spirit and an understanding of how the authors of Revelation thought and the culture of their time. For the Biblical literalist God was giving dictation. For the wise, the authors  were inspired but still human.

"Euthanasia is a very difficult matter.  When absolutely forbidden, it sentences some to horrible, cruel and inhumane pain and suffering; but when the laws allowing it are too wide, allowing people to kill themselves or even having doctors do it for them for reasons that are not eminent death, there are a whole lot of very difficult problems opened up.  What of the children and grandchildren that are deprived of the presence of a family member that would and could have lived for many years?  For this reason I think the state of Montana may have a better idea by decriminalizing it but not allowing rules for physicians to act as Gods.  I do not think that a doctor himself should ever push the medicine that kills, but not to allow a terminally ill patient to take a lethal dose is also extremely cruel and adds to suffering, not palliation of a patients pain and suffering.  The Oregon law is fairly good as the numbers of people remain small. Medical opinion involved butnot doctor termination"

 “To the extent you’re using the resources of a foreign country to run your campaign — that’s an illegal campaign contribution,” according to Nick Akerman, an assistant special prosecutor during the Watergate investigation who now specializes in data crime.

Here’s the second important passage of the statute: “No person shall knowingly solicit, accept, or receive from a foreign national any contribution or donation.” The word ""solicit"" is why it doesn’t matter if Fredo actually got useful information. The part that’s illegal is trying to acquire information from a foreign source, whether or not the solicitation is  successful."

"""Force-selling credit to you for the purpose of putting you in debt for life?"" Come on, that's away over the top. The agent was selling in order to hike his commission or fulfill a target, not to ""put you in debt for life."" 

Consent is a central question here, as it is in other areas nearly as sensitive as cash. If the salesperson felt unable to to reach the assigned target, then ""no"" would have been the right answer -- not ""force-selling"" or (worse still) raising credit limits or moving customers to pricier accounts on the sly. These are the illegal actions of individual employees.  I doubt very much that TD promotes and condones institutionalized fraud. 

Customers are responsible for consent too. Rather than being passively conned and sheared like sheep, the simple word ""no"" works wonders. Do try it.

Right wing funding is bad when it is labelled ""non partisan""  to mislead the viewer or reader into thinking the writer has no agenda, as done in the video. The Fraser Institute being called ""no-partisan"" in the video is a blatant misrepresentation.

I do have concerns about comment deletion, though I imagine some are quite offensive.  (Perhaps the best solution is to do what Rorate and Crux have done and eliminate comments altogether.)
Anyway, my point has to do with the tone of the language in the actual text of NCR stories & editorials.  On a blog, we expect posts to reflect a blogger's personal views.  But NCR is not a blog but a newspaper/news-site, and as such it really should adhere to some journalistic standards.  All media have their POV, but even the NYT, for all its biases, would not rotiely denigrate those who disagree with them as 'fringe',  'extremist', etc (might not some use the same terms to describe the NCR?), or dismiss their opinions as 'hate' and 'vitriol'.

"This is in the Summa:
Aristotle says that a female is an occasioned male. But it would be wrong for something occasioned and [hence] deficient to be part of the initial creation. Therefore woman should not have been a part of that world.”  Summa Theologica, 1, qu. 92, art 1, ob. 1
Thomas: “….. the active power of the semen always seeks to produce a thing completely like itself, something male. So if a female is produced, this must be because the semen is weak or because the material [provided by the female parent] is unsuitable, or because of the action of some external factor such as the winds from the south which make the atmosphere humid. … the female is not accidentally caused but is intended by Nature for the work of generation. Now the intentions of Nature come from God, who is its author. This is why, when he created Nature, he made not only the male but also the female” Summa Theologica, 1, qu. 92, art 1, ad 1."

"Uh huh, I am in accordance with Diverdave's post, and at times, I do not see ""eye to eye"" with his views; but on this occassion, being as I am of Hawaiian ancestry, I agree with his assesment of the situaiton.  As I really do not find anything to be in agreement with those protestors, calling themselves ""avengers, protectors or anything like that"" in their proclamations about Mauna Kea.

Their ""pov"" seems to be about turning back the clock and moving ""backwards"" instead of forwards, into the future.  As the Hawaiian Kingdom had it's day and now is part of history; why try to resurrect it, when it does not fit into today's societal concepts? 

Yet, that seems to be the eventual goal of ""Sovereignty groups"" and those protesting the building of the TMT on Mauna Kea. Why try to separate Hawaiians, from being American's where we have been assimilated and have a brighter future ahead for our children?"

"The recent history is that Humanae Vitae was promulgated to preserve the myth of unchanging moral truth. Indeed, yesterday's article by MSW was full of assumptions that AL was invalid because it did disagree with Veritatis on the same topic. It is a childish worldview and spawned the aphorism that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. The Trads in the Curia are constantly fearing that if they admit to error on a moral teaching, like birth control or homosexuality, that their whole intellectual house of cards will fall.  Of course, the reverse is true. People who have faith and courage enough to admit error actually inspire the trust of the faithful. If their worldview is based on never making a mistake then they will never accept that homosexuals are born not self-chosen. The tragic thing is, people actually suffer real consequences of their arrogance. Drag queens will enter Heaven before they do, if only because the Queens are more fabulous."

"I find it sad that some of the public like yourself keep asking for another pound of flesh from members of a profession that's already worked so hard and sacrificed so much.

Doctors sacrifice and delay their youth, starting a family, becoming financially independent, their freedom and mobility, their family life, missing importance life and family events, and many times their own health and mental wellbeing for years and decades in order to be competent at their craft and serve the public.

And yet people like yourself feel like after all this we should still be treated like indentured servants.

I don't think foreign doctors will treat you with as a customer-friendly attitude as you believe.  Doctors from outside the US tend to work in systems that are more paternalistic and less concerned with quality or patient wishes than our own."

"I prefer that people be discreet about their religious affiliations when not relevant, yes, but when they are given a public forum AS Muslims, I expect them  to use it for what it was meant, i.e. inform the public about their beliefs, just as I expect a priest given a column will express what his beliefs are.

There are splits within the Muslim community, that is obvious to all. The more liberal ones are just as critical of the conservatives as liberal Xians are of fundamentalists, so why isd it that supposedly ""liberal"" newspapers give the conservatives a mouthpiece rather than their liberal critics?

I use ""hijabi"" because that is what they call themselves. Isn't using the term they prefer the politically correct way? And it's interesting that having claimed it is ""prejudice"" to assume all Muslims are ""conservative"", now even wearing a hijab isn't considered ""conservative"", it actually takes a burqa to qualify?

"I understand where you are coming from. However, I remain in the Church, despite all its warts, for deeper reasons. I believe that evolution is directed towards some terminal ""Omega Point"", that humanity stands in the front line of this directed evolution, that the Christian phenomenon--led by the Catholic Church--is in the very vanguard of this directed phenomenon. I cling to the Church, even though I am distressed at its reactionary leadership, because I trust that the Lord is using it as an important vehicle in drawing creation to its intended consummation where ""God may be all in all"" (1 Cor 15:28). I want to collaborate with that plan of God, albeit in the most modest of ways. Of course, this is all a matter of faith. Hopefully, I am not entirely deluded!"

"It appears the OMA leadership is in a difficult position. They have some Doctors who are happy with their high incomes and preferential tax treatment, and others who are unhappy because they want the big pay increases that other public sector unions have received over the past 12 years.
      Unfortunately for Doctors, they don't run and finance the Liberals election campaigns like the teachers and other unions do, so they don't get the paybacks. And the OMA has some specialists who refuse to have their pay lowered, even though they have had huge pay increases because of technology, and their ability to perform more procedures in a much shorter amount of time
     Either way, the pay increases the public sector unions have been receiving are unsustainable with a $300+ Billion deficit and $1 Billion dollars going out the door each month in interest. So the government has to clamp down on costs, especially on health care and Doctor's salary's are a significant component of this expense."

"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08h4y03

Watched an interesting documentary on BBC recently,  profiling the town of Slough, which has experienced a large influx of migrants.

One of the takeaways from the program was the number of second generation  immigrants (of whom there are many) who settled years ago, who are upset over the recent influx of new immigration to the area, and want to see this inflow reduced.  

Of course housing shortages, especially affordable, is one of the issues, but there are others.

This is an area that voted yes to Brexit.

The program is only a half hour - very well worth the watch - as it offers a bit of a counter balance to much of the media here."

"Janhoi,
I agree.  While some seem to think cleaning up financials is easier, I'm not so sure.  This (scandal) is about will, not law.  If the bishops wanted to assure the laity of their sincerity and demanded the pope put in place accountability, including tribunals for involved bishops, it would be done by now.  

Whether the pope himself has the power, almost doesn't matter.  Collectively the bishops clearly don't want to be held accountable, period. But they were OK with financial cleanup, especially as their local finances continue to be rocked by the effects of their own handling of the scandal.  

Am I glad the financial mess is getting cleaned up?  Of course, and Francis get credit.  But I can't shake the sense that the scandal simply remains little more than under storm for the bishops: annoying in that it's messing up their afternoon plans, but little more..."
"I don't have a plan. I believe both the incoming mayor and the south Eugene city council candidates included affordable housing in their platforms. I'm waiting to see what they come up with. 

There is some state money available for affordable housing, due to bills passed in the last session of the state legislature. They also passed a bill making it legal now for cities to pass inclusionary zoning ordinances, which would require developers to include some affordable housing in their developments. The downtown urban renewal district also now requires a certain percentage of apartment projects getting tax breaks to include some ""workforce"" housing.

My guess is that the city will need to put some money into this, as they have into ""revitalizing"" downtown. Since, as you have pointed out, 47 percent of Eugene residents are renters, and rents are too high for a lot of us, something has to be done."

"With any luck, this will prove to be a self-eliminating problem, as those who would kill the unborn, eliminate themselves in so doing; from that same future, shared with those who do not. Speaking of which, if I am not mistaken, Canada's birth rate, has been below the replacement rate, for decades now: hence the need to import people just to keep this place going. I might add that since the Church is regularly criticized for opposing abortion, I would take this opportunity to remind everyone that it was that same Church, that was also furiously criticized, for opposing slavery in the Deep South, prior to the start of the Civil War in the USA. Since slavery there is now banned, I would draw the inference that in due course, so too, will abortion be likewise banned. Fortunately, this procedure can't be used to commit infanticide, where late term abortions that result in live births are then killed. https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/are-babies-left-to-die-when-they-survive-abortion"

"As the fish farming grows world wide, as it will, consumers care about prices and availability more than philosophical arguments by fisherman.  Alaska can and should continue to focus on the quality of wild salmon. Alaska is not going to stop the farming in the rest of the world becasue we do not like farmed fish.  There is a segment of the population who will continue to seeks the best quality available regardless of price.  Those buyers are the exception not the rule. 

As I see the situation  it is parallel to the fast food industry.  There are low priced fast food joints on every corner of most cities.  There also is a place in those cities for the white table cloth restaurants.  The customers of either are there becasue of price and service.  The preponderance of fast food places overwhelms the white table cloth places, serves as evidence that price not quality is what drives the vast majority of  customers through which door."
"I've been from St. John's to Victoria and this American has never encountered a whole Canadian province as ""brain dead"" as our Alabama.  First, Trump appoints Jefferson Beauregard Sessions to be Attorney General.  Look at how that's turning out.  Then the Governor of Alabama gets thrown out of office for, may I use old American slang, a ""roll in the hay"" with a campaign worker he'd appointed to a government job.  The then about to be axed governor appoints ""Big Luther"" Strange, you can't make this up,  to Sessions seat until a primary election is held.

Presto, the great ""white hoard"" disregards the national party and sends Strange packing for an impeached judge who is a certified ""fruitcake"" constantly citing the Bible and damning ""Queers"", ""Democrats"" and everyone not of his way of thinking.

How about when DLNR officers armed with machine guns were arresting kanaka maoli on Mauna Kea? Was that the type of Native Hawaiian advancement you are referring too?

How about the C&C of Honolulu's sit-lie bill, which is the antithesis of ke kanawai mamalahoe, has OHA taken an official position on that?

It's understandable in a high school kid but less so in adults who have been around for decades and is an indication of a misunderstanding of both US history and politics."
"I would depend on how the referendum was worded and how much real education was done with the populace.  In my opinion, the real problem with tax reform is people not processing the scale of the numbers and the purchasing power behind those numbers.  For an example, Trump's fraudulent business school just cost him 25 million in his class action suit.  That sounds like a lot of money and it will mean a great deal to the people in the suit, but if Trump really is worth 5 billion, 25 million of a 5 thousand million net worth still leaves him with 4,975 millions.  So his settlement figure is not exactly going to seriously impact his net worth, much less leave him at a poverty level.  I just wonder how many people can really conceptualize the disparity between the really rich and the average Joe."

alternative may be goats. Goat milk is healthier and as goats can consume almost any kinds of
vegetation, there is no large expense to ship in feed as you would need for cows.

And keep in mind while pension plan owners do get a guaranteed return for life, drop dead early and beyond a lump sum payment, the money stops; unlike a RIF where it can be a tax-free inheritance for someone. DB pension plans have stability and are attractive, but not for everyone and diligent savers and investors can do better."
"I don't shop much in Anchorage, but have always had a soft spot for the Carrs-Sears Mall.  Partially due to memories as a youngster visiting Annabelle with my grandmother, who helped knit booties for Annabelle as well.

It's too bad Sears hasn't done better here in AK.  I use to spend quite a bit of money at Sears during the holidays and wish I knew what happened with AK chains.  Our Valley location has downsized as well and wonder how much longer it will last.

  I want to enter one end of the mall and circle back.  I won't bother to exit the mall to walk around to Nordstrom Rack.  They should be part of the mall in my opinion, not just hanging around.  Hopefully  Nordstrom Rack will listen to it's customers as well as the other merchants."

"The headline is indeed wrong, but it should read “Criticizing Trump isn’t in Canada’s interest _ why don’t the clueless Liberals see that?” Just yesterday, Stéphane Dion, the man Justin Trudeau has made our leading diplomat in Europe, said: “In its own way, the European continent is facing the same challenges as us, ensuring that openness and inclusion triumphs over exclusion and xenophobia”. Take that, Donald Trump! Trudeau hasn’t created and publicized a list of Canadian demands for a revitalized NAFTA, as he should have. He hasn’t done anything but antagonize The Donald. He’s the incompetent leader of an incompetent government."

"Nicolas,you bring up some very interesting & plausible thoughts.

Lets not forget about that serial rapist Greg Poindexter that was preying & raping Alaska Native females immediately around that timeframe. He was eventually convicted & shown to have homicidal ideations by trained professionals. May I add that he attacked & beat a DOC guard while in custody shortly after they arrested him, & the guard couldn't return to work due to extensive injuries. Poindexter lived on the next block over from where Della's body was discovered. Both were considered alternative suspects at trial after extensive evidence was presented showing their propensity of committing the murder.  These other ""petty criminals"" were in fact very dangerous people!"
"Jesus definitely wasn't ""making a statement that God does not need sacrifices"". He was certainly here to tell us that God loves us all, but nonetheless we are only forgiven our sins by a blood sacrifice. That's why the Law given via Moses in Leviticus provided for the covering of certain sins via the death (and blood) of specific animals (see Lev. chapters 1 through 7)

Jesus came to live the perfect (without sin) life so that He would qualify as THE perfect and pure sacrifice to pay for all of our sins, deliberate and unintentional. His blood was poured on the original Mercy Seat on the Ark that resided in heaven, and thereby opened the door for us all to be reconciled with God forever. That's why it says ""once for all"". And that's why the Veil in the Temple in Jerusalem was ripped apart from top to bottom when that was accomplished at His death, to signify that the Levitical Temple  sacrifices were superceded and no longer valid. 

Please see Hebrews 10:1-18."

"It is interesting how quick the Register-Guard is to drop the names of the Koch brothers as supporters of the Tax Foundation, but does not mention the supporters of the Yes on Measure 97 campaign. So here they are:

American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees $1.25 million
Oregon Education Association $1 million
American Federation of Teachers $750,000

The amounts given were the totals for this week alone, according to Willamette Week.

It is clear the teachers unions and government employees are fully on board with 97 as it would add to their membership (17,000 public sector jobs are forecast to be created, but at the expense of 39,000 private sector jobs), and would allow the Oregon legislature to shift current funding from schools to pay the PERS obligations once Measure 97 proceeds are available to use as a replacement.

"""Lincoln fired McClellan because he wasn't ruthless enough.""

Not exactly. Before Lincoln was elected president, he was a lawyer/lobbyist for the Illinois Central Railroad, where McClellan was vice president and chief engineer. McClellan resented having to take orders from someone who had been his subordinate. In November 1861, Lincoln came to the house where McClellan had his headquarters on the ground floor and his living quarters upstairs. McClellan kept the president waiting for half an hour, then sent someone down to tell Lincoln he had gone to bed.

McClellan kept dithering during the Peninsular Campaign of 1862. Lee pulled a massive bluff on McClellan, getting him to believe that the Confederates greatly outnumbered him. McClellan abandoned the campaign, which he could have won. Had he taken Richmond, the war would likely have been shortened, since he would have the Tredegar Iron Works, the only steel mill/cannon foundry/locomotive factory in the South."

"Nathan,

I guess we'll just have to wait and see how things work out.

In these discussions I'm hearing a lot of doubts expressed about Trump's ability to pick good leaders and make good decisions. That's primarily left-leaners who see things changing and mourning that their candidate lost. What gives me hope is that Trump is CEO of a complex and profitable $11B corporation. He didn't get there by being stupid and over the years he has developed a keen skill for evaluating people for their leadership abilities and putting them in positions where they can develop and deliver both growth and profits. So it will be interesting seeing how quickly and severely his management style conflicts with the entrenched bureaucracy and how much change he is actually able to drive. He has outlined an aggressive 100-day plan that I think is going to surprise a lot of bureaucrats by how quickly it knocks their ivory towers out from under them."

I think it unlikely they would completely abandon Trudeau so soon but it wouldn't take a lot of them shifting to Scheer to drop the Liberals to a minority government, especially if the NDP gets its act together."
Why would China build roads made of silk- that is a very expensive commodity ! and belts--everybody has a belt already in a very saturated market. How about an elevated rail network going all around the world at a cost of 8 trillion dollars to deliver leather roads and silk belts ? Now that could work ! Can I buy into the stock now- I have a whole bunch of Confederate bonds. Will China export its smog and water pollution too ?

"""Parliament's definition of consent does not extend to advance consent to sexual acts committed while the complainant is unconscious,"" Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote for the majority. (2011)

In other words, consent must be on-going and that is obviously impossible when a person is unconscious.

"The executive branch does not define, without limit or constraint, the interests of the state.  The entire US constitution is set up to make any action difficult by requiring alignment by all 3 branches of government.  There is always friction between them and that is by design.  Congress passes legislation, the president vetoes it, then congress over-rides the veto.  Someone takes the new law to the Supreme Court that then rules it illegal.  Those ""well-defined functions"" result in friction and all of that is by the intent and design of the US constitution.   So if a President signs and executive order (bypassing Congress, a bad precedent set by Obama but now used shamelessly by Trump) and a judge stays it on grounds it is against the law, that is the system.  That is not a conspiracy.  There is no ""deep state"" except in the minds of some very frustrated Trump supporters.  Trump is not a CEO he is President (and not a wanna-be tyrant).  The rules are different.  apply the rules."

Literally, this election cycle is their Waterloo, as they now have a candidate that espouses their views and down-ticket candidates that are all on the same page - and they are all going to war with the liberals and moderates. What the Tea Party is about to find out is, upon the defeat of Trump, Ms. Stenger and others who espouse a racist, sexist, bigoted philosophy is that it will be an absolute defeat. That will, in turn, give more moderate voices in the Republican Party enough power to truly oust the Tea Party/Freedom Caucus/Sean Hannity/Breitbart pols from the mainstream and relegate their entire movement to the trash heap of political history."
"It's no surprise that LGBTQ youth are more likely to turn to drugs and violence when they are pushed out of their homes and communities by intolerant Christians.

I don't think you realize the utter pain and torture your ideas cause, and for what? So you can thump your bible?

You're free to have whatever ideas you want. If you think homosexuality is a sin then by all means live that way. But I draw the line when you think that freedom and justice means telling people who to love and what they can or cannot do in the bedroom. The bigotry and intolerance is vivid."

I am glad you suggested they be placed in museums (assuming the ignorant mobs don't destroy them first).

I do not regard the statues as symbols of the confederacy but as monuments to history. I don't know any southerners that are proud of slavery (and I know a lot of southerners since I grew up there). I don't know any that want to intimidate blacks. Actually, I think they want blacks to propser and have opportunities.

I'd posit that a far better way to handle this situation, it to erect statues of black heroes, like Martin Luther King as a counter-balance."

These amounts are total appropriations for each of the mentioned fiscal years and are from the State Departments own budget report. So where was the cuts in funding? What I see is an increase of about 2 billion per year for the Diplomatic and Consular Services as reported by the State Department. I sure wish this fairy tale about republicans cutting funding would go away."

If so, was the drug administered just before the test (and after the race), or was it administered earlier in a very high dose to begin with?

We lost businesses because of that factor when other communities offered expedited permitting and cooperation.

It is a big deal for private investors due to the time value of money.  A public employee who is used to sitting on their butts with almost no consequence for delays in work has a hard time understanding why this is such a big deal to potential employers and other investors.

"Typical conservative economics.  Feed the base with the rhetoric of smaller government and lower taxes and then magically claim you will balance the budget because everyone (corporations) will be willing to invest in a Bernier government.  Ignore the fact that corporations have been sitting on a ton of reserve wealth that they are not spending already.    

Please conservative voters, see through this for the nonsense it is.   Harper thought the same when he cut the GST by 2%; it would stimulate spending by consumers.  Where instead the result of that was an additional $110billion in debt we are now paying interest on for a generation.   That is not smart economics no matter how much you like the words lower taxes....he is an irresponsible con man and is pandering to his base."
"Tax cuts for corporations may or may not trickle down, depending on who really pays the tax. If it really comes at the expense of workers than it should be expanded to a full-on value added tax or net business receipts tax and be paid by all employers, not just corporations, with most families no longer filing taxes, with the Child Tax Credit paid through employers and added to every paycheck. In this case, investments can be deducted when made rather than amortized, as is usual, but they don’t have to be (at some point OECD rules come into play). As for repatriation, if we raise dividend and capital taxes to the normal income rate (cutting all deductions except for sales to-a qualified ESOP) and have only the top 10-20% of families pay it (with graduated increases), then bring all the money back to the US tax free, making sure Steve Forbes pays at a 28% rate when he gets his dividend check (take it off the top)."

Today's mediums for promotion are much different than in the past, where you had to have a sponsorship from a Doges of King (and we all know how rare those were). As mass-media blossomed you needed an agent to align you to a distribution chanel, such as a record label. Now each of us can access YouTube, Vine, etc. to post my latest creative idea, but I need facebook, Instagram, etc. and a network of friends to help promote it.

As for the government, they need to support those that become successful, not try to pick the winners. And the more successful, especially internationally, the more."

I would absolutely love to see the media explain why they cover these catty lawsuits regarding the immigration suspension and why not one of them are covering the lawsuits against the DNC for its corruption and rigging in the primaries.
"Why is it that Americans have become our worst enemies?  Black segregation occurred many years ago.  Japanese internment camps occurred many years ago.  And so on....  but it seems that many generations later, after the wrong has been corrected, the grandchildren/great grandchildren seems to act as if it happened to them, so they feel it is their right to protest, throw tantrums, threaten lawsuits/persecute and so on...  Is that really how we want our children to be raised?  With a sense of entitlement in all that they do?  If they fail, cry foul and pout, and pass the blame on their bosses.  If that doesn't work, blame what happened 40-60 years ago or longer?  This is not how I want my children and grand children to be raised and taught.!  Cmon and let's move on people!  Stop with the nonsense.  Even as I write this, I thread lightly so not to hurt any feelings.  So much for freedom of speech huh!"

"There is something wrong with the narrative on this. If it is truly as barbaric and causes unremitting lifelong pain, why would veterinarians do it? The position of the AVMA is educate patients and push alternatives, but not ""don't do it"". Why would there be so many cats who, having undergone the procedure, live 10-15 years as happy and affectionate pets? Yeah, I get that cats can hide pain. But not long term. I've had them all my life until a month ago. 

If it were as terrible as some opponents say, it seems that euthanasia would be recommended if the only way to keep the cat is declawing. But it is considered to be preferable to euthanising a problem cat who won't stop scratching inappropriately. 

I have to wonder if there are some vets that do it better than others? Studies apparently do not support a connection between declawing and bad behavior. I think there is a lot of misinformation in the arguments."
"Of note UAF has not gone from having a Chancellor to no Chancellor overnight.

Mike Powers is still interim Chancellor and will be through the end of the summer, when a different interim Chancellor will be hired (I think Mike would rather go fishing than continue to make 300 k/yr, which I respect). The transition from UAF Chancellor to no UAF Chancellor will likely take time as the UA system is reorganized."

"""For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.""

"Some people at ADN/NYT need to do some checking. Michigan already did a re count and Trump actually picked up 500 and some votes.

The Clinton campaign is funding Stein to do this so's they don't look like the sore looser."
I am an Anesthesiologist who works in a Toronto Hospital - the VAST majority of Anesthesiologists (I know of none in the 416 area code) are NOT paid by the Hospital.  Please list your reference(s) that claim that Anesthesioloigsts are directly paid (a salary) by their Hospitals.  Perhaps you are mistaking Pathologists (where the majority are paid a salary by their Hospitals) with Anesthesiologists - Pathologists work on dead people while I keep my patient alive.
"Dilbert cartoonist and 'Internet Pundit' Scott Adams had tweeted earlier today
""If you want to see a glitch in the simulation, ask someone on the other team what they thought of #Trump's speech. 2 movies on 1 screen."" as an illustration of the cognitive dissonance originating from Trump's win.
Elizabeth Renzetti's article captures it perfectly.  Many didn't see any malice in his inauguration address at all - put she HAS to keep this movie playing in her head (and sharing it in her writing) or else she would have to admit she might, perhaps, have been a little wrong about Trump.  This would of course be unacceptable - therefore - cognitive dissonance."
"Get over it Clinton Cheerleaders.  Hillary Clinton and husband  Bill are never going to be President and a Shadow President.  On January 20th, 2017 Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States. President Obama will resume his community organizing as a race hustler to keep Black people fearful, angry, resentful, and even hostile to white people in order to keep them in the Democrat Party a dependency class. And he will go on the speaking circuit internationally getting filthy rich badmouthing his own country and advocating one world government under the United Nations in order to save the planet from GLO-BULL warming,

Oh by the way, the Democrat norms have created a $20 trillion dollar national debt, an $800 billion dollar trade imbalance, less that a 2% economic growth over the last years, 46 million Americans on welfare, 93 million out of the workforce,  a real unemployment of 10%+ not the 6% reported by the GAO, and the disaster called Obamacare."
"Heroin is just another opioid in the same drug class as morphine and dilaudid.   It happens to be a wonderful drug for cancer pain and is used for that in other counties similar to how morphine and dilaudid is used here and sold in pharmacies. 

Unfortunately heroin shares the same problems as morphine, dialudid, Percocet, etc.  Unlike cannabis, they are physcially addictive and can kill you.

But in answer to your question, “how do you make an illegal drug legal?” You demonstrate that is is useful for treating certain diseases and conditions without having worse side effects than the disease it’s treating.  Once you demonstrate that, we have a moral and ethical obligation to make that treatment available. 

Currently medical cannabis patients must be seen and evaluated by a licensed physician before being prescribed cannabis.

Out of curiousity, what are your thoughts on morphine, penicillin, and aspirin?"
"Cliches and one word comments laced with personal insults will get you elected.  It worked for Sarah Palin (for a while) and look how Donald Trump is doing.

"How do any of those options preempt someone from talking about the morality of sexuality? All people experience sexuality in their own way. One of the big myths about Chastity within an over-sexualized culture (thats us by the way) is that the lack of intercourse entails a lack of sexuality. In reality, chastity is the proper way of living out one's sexuality which takes different particular forms according to different vocations. In marriage having intercourse with one's spouse happens within the context of chastity, but this is obviously no so in religious life. Whether or not they have sex, all priests, religious, married, and single people experience sexuality in their own way."

"Actually....I think the ""credulous"" have some clear responsibility, too.

Turning over your adult decision making to a group of hierarchy is simply not a very adult thing to do.

One can consider their opinion if one wishes or feels so inclined, but making serious personal decisions...and a presidential vote is surely one....is the responsibility, ultimately, of the ""decider"".

What I suspect is that we have a number of ""credulous"" and very ""unadult"" members who have never truly grown up to real dependent adulthood, in a developmental sense,....hence ""the bishop says"" model.

I'd assess it at about 15 years old and that may not be fair to teenagers."
"there needs to be rule changes. one possibility is that anyone must have been a member for six months to be involved in leadership selection. this will help end ""instant"" tories with little or no attachment to a party.  the other possibility is primaries like in france, where voters pay a modest fee before voting to elect  the presidential candidate of a party.  such  voters need not be members of that particular party, and when it involves millions of people it is hard to skew the result."

"Not complaining about ""corporate interests"" sir.  If they can make a fair profit without subsidies then fine.  I`m pretty specific who I am concerned with. I`m an old retired Alaskan voter concerned with corruption in the peoples house, enabled through illegal gerrymandering and conflicted legislators who have in the past and still are in positions to steer billions in revenue away from the owners of the oil (us) to their employers.. Or are you one of the republicans who believes the cartel owns the oil just because they leased the rights to share the benefit with the state from it`s production? 
I never said Alaska was Kansas. You can dismiss your Kansas corporate socialist brethren`s wise realization that your trickle down economics doesn`t work.  It speaks volumes.   Your a shameful pandering shill.

"Common sense would inform the rational that laws should only punish those who harm others with their actions. Propose a law which enhances the penalties for using a firearm modified to permit continuous fire (covers ""bump stocks & rubber bands) in the commission of a crime and you will have near universal support from every segment of society. Propose a law which bans the manufacture, sale or possession of a bump stock, which any rational individual knows will not stop a single crime, and you have a fight on your hands. So what do the collectivists do? Seek to divide instead of find common ground. Par for the course, which is why there is no compromise with today's party of Democrats."

"Affordable housing gets built pursuant to tax #3, immediately becomes less affordable pursuant to tax #2.  Brilliant!"
One factor working agains this prediction is that the decline of the Euro against the USD - thanks in part to Donald Trump's inflating inducing budget plan - is a de facto devaluation that is likely to help paper over the economic weakness of the southern European economies. The Euro is a good bet to slip below par with the USD.
"I forgot for the moment that primary and secondary Catholic schools in the States are private schools. In most of Canada Catholic schools are publicly funded... in Anglophone Canada we speak of ""public"" and ""separate"" (=Catholic) schools. Our problem is that this formerly just situation in which public schools were unambiguously protestant and separate schools were catholic, has been disrupted with the influx of Muslims and other non-Christian faiths who are busily setting up their own private, not-publicly funded schools. 

With the increase of secularism, the demand to defund Catholic schools will increase, despite constitutional protection. Our bishops are too fixated in their contentment with what we have to notice the injustice in favour of Catholics. They could use the existing constitutional protection to barter away Catholic privilege for a single public system in which all faiths (including secular) have the right to teach their religion as an optional subject. Not on radar."

"Eye in the Sky did a good job of showing the competing considerations that ought to determine any military action, those of a civilian government and its political (national and international) concerns, the moral questions of how much collateral damage is appropriate given the opportunities to prevent much larger scale damage, and those of the military who are charged with defending us at the same time that they are restricted by their civilian masters (hopefully).  I am not sure what Middleton wants, but I and others who joined me in the screening we watched, were riveted by the competing needs to act and to hesitate.  Quite possibly increasing the percentage of non-white characters might contribute to a better movie, but I am not clear how; perhaps Middleton would like us to see the perspective of those plotting the suicide bombings and the social and religious underpinnings of their motives to act."

"Aloha Mr. Matsuoka, 

Mahalo for your mana'o.  How were those beers?  As you may already be aware, Kamehameha's Kanawai Mamalahoe was just a reiteration of laws that other ali'i had passed throughout the course of Kanaka Maoli history.  

The context for Kanawai Mamalahoe's passage was really the treatment of civilians during wartime - it really was jus in bello/humanitarian law (long pre-dating the Geneva and Hague conventions). 

It's place in the laws of our State can find themselves within the context of civil/human rights.  It is difficult to manage, however, because the last line of Kanawai Mamalahoe is ""hewa no, make (Break this law and die),"" which suggest capital punishment (which we do not have here).  

Your comment begs the greater question regarding the protection of the people, especially our most vulnerable populations and indeed, we can and should be doing better.  Perhaps we ought to draft a bill and push policy on better civil/human rights laws?  Mahalo nui loa."
"So even the users and mass transit advocates say this was poorly done?  These flaws aren't easy fixes, either; they're baked into the entire concept.  Think about that the next time you see an anti-EmX sign.  Remember how those concerns were belittled, downplayed or even ignored?  Remember how we didn't get to vote for this (or even vote for the board that shoved this down our throats)?  It gets worse:  LTD admits that this project increases congestion; that means more idling (a LOT more idling), which is directly contrary to the City of Eugene's climate recovery goals.

"The reason I say ""borderline"" is because Gianforte has not yet been elected to congress. If he were than it would be unconstitutional. ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

"btg:
Good points all.  It is noteworthy that the experts who lecture us on the gain from mass refugees' immigration never discuss the solid option of a low population density economy.  They hold fast to the creed of population growth =economic growth, omitting the key mediating factor of population productivity.  In today's Canadian economy, that productivity depends crucially on high literacy in English or French.  The current pace of Syrian refugees into Canada means that many of these people may not receive the education necessary to make them fluent in English or French: the country does not have sufficient dedicated teachers and schools to meet the need.  The current mass immigration of refugees from Syria and Africa is sowing an underclass phenomenon that will haunt Canada for a very long time if not forever."

"Before the LRT construction, I used to walk west on the north side of Eglinton toward Eglinton West Station.  Countless times, cars turning from Eglinton onto the Allen would blow through red lights and almost hit pedestrians who were crossing legally at the base of the Allen.  Even though this was occurring just 100 feet from a police station, I never saw any enforcement.  Adjustments were made to the timing of the traffic lights, so the City was clearly aware there was a problem, but no one could be bothered to hand out tickets and demerit points to dangerous drivers.  There were some occasions where arrests would have been appropriate.  In the words of my hero, Donald Trump: sad!"

What makes people do that? Kill the thing they love? (Oscar Wilde: Ballad of Reading Goal)

It obviously fascinated Shakespear too, this human tendency/weakness, since he made it the subject of his tragedies, like Othello.

I guess we'll never know fully the answer to that one."
"Giving tax money to the EDC is like setting out milk and cookies for Santa  --  except that in real life, the parents who leave presents under the tree also get to eat the cookies.

"@The Anchor, ""Why"" you ask? In a word, risk. Employees risk nothing financially and are supported by the social safety net that their tax dollars only partially pay for. Business owners risk financial ruin by investing their own resources in businesses which may or may not eventually turn a profit and have little recourse if their business generates losses. They also wind up paying for their employees' public benefits through payroll taxes but are not necessarily eligible for those same benefits.

Our capitalist system is based on business activity, even a losing business benefits the economy generally but without them there is no foundation for supporting the society we enjoy. The tax system needs to treat entrepreneurs fairly for the risks they take, otherwise they have no incentive to create businesses or employ anyone. Society benefits from the employment that a business offers, not the other way round."
"A generation after the construction of Deady Hall, those who were then most aware of the history of the creation of the UO and who had been involved, with Deady, in its administration during that ensuing generation - determined to name the first UO building after this man. 

There is no evidence that they named the building after Deady because of his then moot stance on slavery - a stance taken most fervently 40 years before. 

But there is plenty of evidence that they named it after him because of his instrumental, leading personal role in creating the institution, the siting of campus in Eugene instead of Salem, the fund-raising for the construction of the building and the administration of the little college for its first decades.

"OK - I'll delete the part of my comment that Trudeau might be a closet ........................... but the part about some, especially US politicians, thinking that father Pierre might be a communist is historical fact.

Sadly, when I read or listen to media presentations about M-103 two thoughts come to mind.

First, I think that this is just purposeful distraction concocted by Gerry Butts and Justin to distract Canadians from the Liberals' abysmal financial performance and the impact of such high long-term debt on Canada's interest costs.

Secondly, I wonder if perhaps ................... this is the part I've deleted.

Under either scenario, Canada is doomed to suffer the same unrest as is being experienced in Europe.

Will our politicians and their advisors ever put the well-being of Canadians first above their own petty, partisan self-interests?"

"Unfortunately, as someone who has grew up in the Catholic Church and went to Catholic schools, I did see the discrepancies in how the wealthy and poor were treated.  For instance, the  Catholic high school I went to had a strict honor code where you could be expelled for things that you did outside of school.  Of course the honor code only applied to the poor Latino scholarship students while the wealthy kids were never disciplined.  (And this was in the 1990s BTW).  After the hypocrisy I witnessed first hand, it wouldn't shock me if some bishops were pulling strings for the wealthy - i.e. annulments.  

And I am sure that you and many other priests are currently doing good work with this but my concern is that AL won't really help many divorcees outside of liberal parishes where they were already being helped.  My liberal parish will continue to welcome remarried people but I am afraid that many other parishes won't."

"Compare and contrast the Charlottesville riot with the peaceful protest in Knoxville last night.  Both cities host the state's university,  and both cities were the scene of protests against Confederate statuary.  Charlottesville had fights,  injuries and a death.  Knoxville had none of those.  Perhaps its because the KPD set up a fence around the memorial in question,  and a barricade down the middle of the street,  keeping the pro-monument folks on one side and the counter-protesters on the other.  Charlottesville Police and Virginia State Police, OTOH, allowed, some might say forced, the two sides into contact,  with the predictable result.  Personally, I blame Gov McAwful for allowing the contact."
"I agree that the short notice is certainly going to cut down on the number of folks who will show up to voice their opinions. Even more important however, is the location of the sites for comment.

Places like the Oakway Center, Valley River Center, Woodfield Station, and other high foot traffic areas would have been better choices."

"Here's Germany's experience with legalized prostitution. 

http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/welcome-to-paradise/

If our laws against coercion worked well, there would not be as much exploitation in this country.  We don't want laws that only serve to punish criminals once a victim has been exploited.  We need to avoid creating incentives that would allow the sex industry to prosper.  I have no problem with someone (unrelated to me) deciding to work in the sex trade.  Just don't dilute our laws for their benefit.

Prostitution will never ""work the same way"" as other occupations because people will never feel the same way about their relatives working these jobs and most clients will always demand extreme privacy (unless of course we enact laws that would result in Canada becoming a destination for sex tourists - I'm sure people flying in from San Diego won't care as much who sees them entering the safe, legal brothel in Richmond, BC)."

"For all the bluster from ""conservatives"" (they aren't when you look at how much money they spend & how tax cuts for people making millions per year are more important than balancing the budget) about pushing coal the actual facts are clearly going the other way. Red states like Texas, Kansas and Wyoming have a growing percentage of their energy needs coming from solar and wind. Drive the interstate through Wyoming and its especially obvious. Fracking means more oil production which has mean more natural gas which is far cheaper than coal. In 10-15 years I'll bet solar and wind will provide more energy than natural gas. Nat gas, solar and wind are cheaper than coal. What's wrong with consumers paying less for energy?  Heck, even the coal museum in Kentucky recently converted to solar! For people who say they care about coal miners they'd be better off encouraging manufacturing of solar, wind and batteries (electric cars) in former coal areas than saying they're bringing back coal jobs."

The fact that Jacob Zuma is the spider in the centre of the whole tangled web magnifies his own cynical disregard for ""our people"".

If you steal or have in your possession a stolen weapon, once again illegal.

 I don't even have a problem with a no-buy list. As long as certain come with it. 1) notification that you are on the list within 10 days. 2) A hearing before a judge to explain why the government feels that they have to prevent you from  a Right. 3) A civilian over-site committee in each county to over see all aspects of the program with the power to over rule the local judges decision.

"`No`, responded MacDonald, `But I do know a little about politics

Spot on.  This not about Mulroney's serenading Trump's pals, it's about politics.   Sir John A MacDonald was a crafty political animal, disliked by many but he promised the railway as bulwark against American expansion. The debate in the Commons was bitter, often spiteful.  He was pilloried in the press but his political gamesmanship got us the railway.  

There is something peculiarly diseased in the minds of people who would unilaterally hate a politician.  Bill Clinton was a womanizing and manipulative philanderer but many would argue the USA and the world did well under his rule.   That's politics."

"Sorry Justin - but it's important that Americans understand that the vast majority of Canadians think it's wrong - imagine if they thought Trudeau's decision - regardless of his justification - represented the position of Canadians as a whole? Now THAT would possibly have undermined our relationship with the US. For those that think we should all be quiet and maybe we can sneak it by the Americans - that's naive - no matter how sneakily the Liberals did it - it was going to be big news sooner or later. Although Trudeau wears a bit of egg on his face, Canada is better off with the Americans knowing Canadians don't like what happened."

"Unfortunately this man was once my uncle! I looked up to him, had a degree of respect for him! When I was 14 years old. One of my brothers who were adopted, came forward and said this man who we all trusted and loved very much, had been sexually abusing him! Later came out he had done this to many of our relatives. Of course he didn't just wake up one day and decide to be a monster (well maybe he did)? But his father abused him from an early age. Also abused my mom! Thankfully the time came and she was brace enough to get away from him! Abuse is awful of this caliber, and nothing less than a death sentence should be issued! 
Once my brother came out with what he had done. Daniel Stephen Johnson fled to Cambodia, where he set himself in a position of power over small boys! I've told people for years what kind of monster he is. Just now light is Winn shed on it. Unfortunately one of my brothers committed suicide 3 years ago, because of the abuse he was adopted into. He is 💯 guilty!"

Unforuntantely even the most independent of media is no protection against fake news. In the rush to make money sitting on stories while they are verified can be a losing position for media outlets. Sites like Facebook do not want to vet stories posted on its site because that will cost huge money, compromising their business models and could lead to liability for content.

A better solution to stop fake news is to have huge penalties that even teenages in Macedonia cannot hide from. The same should go for any media outlet that passes on fake news, whether or not it knew or should have known it was fake.

Penalties must be harsh enough to make everyone in the chain of creation and distribution of fake news think twice. Distance must be no impediment to enforement."

Regarding cockroaches, they are ubiquitous in East Coast cities, including in the mansions of the wealthy. Even new construction is almost instantly infested. Washington DC is a big Eastern city and it is cockroach infested. The White House probably requires  fumigation from time to time. It really is no big deal.

Right.  ""... with enough storage"" it's ""Possible"" With sums equivalent to the GDP of a nation maybe. The amounts of storage required to power a nation's grid sufficiently for anything much beyond a power generator's capacity factor is truly staggering. 

The Bob goes on to say ""Do realize that nuclear can have only a limited penetration unless we install enough storage to time-shift output from low demand to high demand periods. That's why the world has built most of its pump-up hydro storage. To time-shift nuclear.""

Despite her flaws, Clinton was more moderate than Trump, which is why I think she won Colorado. I think she would have won the country if Dems weren't such lazy voters."

"Considering the first sentence that I received via e-mail, it's not hard to see why it didn't make it through.   Disgraceful.

"If I were in the shoes of the President, I would count the number of reporters, divide that number by five , the number of days in the week, and each reporter would be assigned a press day and they would be allowed to ask ""one"" question for the week and that is done.

"Don't paint with too big of a brush, Kc.  Back in 1992 when President Bill Clinton was in office, he implemented the Welfare to Work legislation and the Republicans hated him for it because it did force able body people to move off of welfare and into the job market.  Employers jumped on board  because they received a hefty tax credit for every welfare recipient that they put to work.  If you visit Alaska's DHS public assistance website, you'll discover that there's a limitation of how long an able body adult can draw public assistance, and then their eligibility stops.  Children are permitted to  be on public assistance until they turn 18.  There's a lot of moving parts to being eligible for welfare or public assistance.  Seventy-seven percent of people on public assistance is children.  Check out DHS' website and see for yourself."
"What a glowing commentary about Kitty.  From what I've seen and read over the years along with my trips to downtown, Doppelt and I have different takes on what she has turned Eugene in to.  I give her credit though, she has turned it in to a pretty nice ""traveler"" and homeless community."
Paul says nothing about the ordination of men either.
Who keeps track of these homeless? How are they identified?  Are they fingerprinted?

"Richard you are wrong.  Lotsa Alaska pilots at K2.   Where the drivers license is from doesn't matter.    Their personal safety attitude and record does.   The glacier landing pilots aren't trainees - they are experienced.

"In a case like this,  how does affordable housing look? City owned property, rented or sold at a lower than market price to some selected individuals? Does the city tale a net loss on this? If so,  how does the city decide whose housing is subsidized by other tax payers? What is the city's cost on a per unit basis?

Honestly asking here."
State employees got a pay raise but education got slashed.  Maybe kids need a union that gives thousands of dollars in campaign donations to the governor.
"I enjoyed this thoughtful piece Laureli and have experienced some of the same emotions when traveling & living in rural Alaska for the past fifty years.
   That ugly concept  racial & other prejudice - applies to & exists in different degrees in every human. As long as people are obviously different in skin color, languages, height, weight & other aspects - there will be innate prejudice to some degree. Some prejudices are subliminal & not recognized by any but their victims. The ""brown"" money changers probably had heard of counterfeit money foisted by locals, so you fit the description of local & your money was rejected. 
    It is the duty of government & individuals to referee - to keep the degree of prejudice from exceeding acceptable civil limits. Tolerance must enter the equation to temper innate prejudices & keep them from becoming excessive. 

Perfect absence of racism or prejudice will never be achieved. But we should work toward that as an idealistic goal."

"The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act does not authorize any reversals.

It's called due process."
"CIA seemed split on that one. White House/Bush toady & CIA Director George Tenet claimed a ""slam dunk"" case for Iraq having WMD. He sat beside Colin Powell when the latter was presenting his ridiculous case for the same at the UN.

Other CIA agents like Joe Wilson actively debunked the claim of yellow cake flowing to Hussein from Niger. His wife was an active agent in Iraq, outed by the Bush WH.

The problem was you had to sort through info, decide who was legitimate, understand what the role of UN weapons inspectors really was - not drink the faecal soup handed out by networks like FOX. Many were not up to the challenge - or indifferent, or anxious to reap the benefits of plunder like our own Harper."
"Anyone who disagreed with this post does not have an ounce of compassion in them, or are completly ignorant of the issues surrounding the medevil and barbaric practices that are still in use in CHina.

Seems you posted that exact comment only a few minutes before and then quickly deleted it, and then re posted it as ""RS"" At least now i understand why the person i have been talking to appears to be so thick.  We had this conversation multiple times and you flatly ignored all of the information, data and statistics i posted for you over and over. I see nothing has changed with you, Oh, that is except your new alias. 
You go ahead and call me what you want, i don't need to HIDE behind multiple aliases so people don't recognize me.
I love it when people like you screw up.

"I don't know if one anecdotal tale is evidence that legalization was a mistake. At most, you've described a case of an inconsiderate neighbor. A neighbor who could be asked if he or she could possibly smoke elsewhere. 

It is an obnoxious smell, and I smoke outside and occasionally wonder just how much the neighbors can smell, and hope that they'll let me know if it's an issue, so that I can try and find somewhere else to do it, or to try to smoke when they aren't home. I already do this as much as possible, weather permitting.

Something being an inconvenience to someone, however, isn't really reason to make it illegal. I haven't seen any studies indicating that incidental secondhand cannabis smoke is all that hazardous. By the time it's wafting into someone else's house, it's dissipated greatly from the concentrations that the user is inhaling."

"Agree.  When river road was widened, at first they did not increase the speed limit, which remained at 30 mph.  I received the first speeding citation shortly thereafter, and I was traveling at about 35-40.  Then they raised the limit to 40 mph, but 45-50 is the new norm everywhere on River Road, where you will not find a police cruiser.  I hate impeders, but on River Road I feel a public duty use the left lane while going exactly 40 mph.  Because 30 mph was the correct speed limit!"

"Cheap labour or, if you go back 150 years, slave labour based societies don't do well in the long run.   Consumer societies in the Walmart-nation mold are based on debt and extreme income stratification.  

A broad based economy whose emphasis is on production not consumption can offer all of its citizens living wage jobs.  The ""very narrow interests"" are the elites who benefit from cheap labour and asset inflation.  The consumers you say are benefiting from cheap labour really aren't because their wages are low and they are going into debt.

High wage countries can have elevated social safety nets and fiscal balance but low wage countries cannot.  Getting your car hand washed for $4 doesn't compensate for this.

Cheers,

"You should be at some of the shoplifting episodes I have had to deal with.  Maybe they haven't gotten physical yet.  But I am sick and tired of having to deal with this.  I have been dealing with more issues this year than the last 15 years combined, all because of SB91.  Sure it is working because no one is getting arrested anymore.  The number of small crimes is growing to the point the police cannot even handle them all of which is why most often they don't even show up anymore or if they do it is hours and in some cases days later.  I have had rocks thrown through my windows after forcing punks out and yet I have no rights.  The criminals have all of the rights, I have no recourse whatsoever.  How is that fair?  Is that your idea of the way things should be?  I cant touch them, I cannot shoot them and they know it so it is just getting worse and worse which is why the number of violent crimes will continue to grow as well, ask any cop.  Theft and drug crimes need severe punishment"
"As convenient as it is to say to score some cheap political point, Bill Clinton & Dick Cheney-- different as night & day politically-- are not draft dodgers, any more than citizens who deduct their mortgage interest are tax evaders!  They took advantage of the law relative to student & marital exemptions as it existed during the Viet Nam war as did millions of other American men of that era.  Perhaps mandatory military service for all would have some merit to enact-- e.g., make us more thoughtful about invading other countries-- but a veteran's opinion is no more or less valid than anyone else's on most topics.  The question should be ""What was Trump elected to do?""  Pontificate and tweet his brand of demagoguery, or devise and implement ideas to improve our country and our world?"
Excellent article.
"Actually, that's not true. The Tories keep trying to call Trudeau a neophyte, but they ignore the facts. Trudeau grew up surrounded by political debate. He was active in high school. He debated at McGill. He chaired a committee on youth renewal in the party in 2006. He was elected to Parliament in 2008. He became leader of the Liberal Party in 2012. By comparison, Trudeau has had years of political experience to O'Leary's 15 minutes."

"If Donald Trump had a grain of leadership in him, his tone now would be conciliatory and welcoming. He would address especially the fears of those who think him personally unfit to lead. He would feel and act humbled by the responsibility he's assumed.

But what do we get instead? Braggadocio, vindictivemess, lies. Reckless attacks on the very intelligence agenies on which he must rely for critical information in times of crisis. Meaningless sideshows about saving a few jobs here or there. Bizarre fawning on a Russian dictator who means no good to this country. Impulsive tweets that call into question fundamental policies and old alliances. Refusal to separate his personal financial interest from his public responsibilites--even to disclose his financial links to foreign nations, especially Russia.

The only thing Trump really cares about is his personal image, his brand. None of this is about his country. It's all about him. Great job, America. You sure picked a winner this time."
And leftists who also take advantage of the US tax code. Just ask the Clinton's how they live off their so called charitable foundation.

"In 1907, William Randolph Hearst's newspaper chain was battling President McKinley, just as the media is at war with Trump, today.  In a nationally published editorial, Hurst implored, “Will somebody please put a bullet in president""  Three days later McKinley, visiting the Buffalo World's Fair, was assassinated.  The killer said he read it in the newspaper and thought it was his patriotic duty.  Of course, Hurst claimed he had nothing to do with it. Only after that was  uttering death threats deemed illegal without violating the right to free speech"

"Schumer's words imply that he previously HAD confidence in Trump -- this despite every indication that Trump was, is, and always will be absolutely untrustworthy.  I seriously doubt whether anyone in Canada's government has confidence in anything other than lies, bullying, bluster, and self-centered greed on Trump's part, but the nasty reality is that Canada must deal with him somehow.  There's a huge difference between mistrusting someone and  demonstrating that mistrust with words or actions that provoke reactions that might exacerbate already-likely damage to Canada. It's dangerous enough living next door to a feral elephant; an elephant in must is a truly terrifying prospect."

2. Carter v. Canada, 2015 - the one that said those suffering intolerable pain had a right to physician-assisted dying."

"U.S. exported $266 billion in goods to Canada last year.
U.S. exported $262 billion in goods to Mexico last year.

"The last number of weeks have had no shortage of articles speculating on the meeting this Monday between Trudeau and Trump. The articles by and large tended to be cautiously optimistic, but certainly didn't set the bar that high for expected outcomes. If you don't expect much , you won't be disappointed, and perhaps here is where Trudeau may do well. The emphasis would be on ""may"" as it's hard to call. However it's highly unlikely that Americans want to pick a fight with their closest neighbour, trading partner and friend. Canadians and Americans, know each other quite well. We vacation in each others countries, we have each have friends on both sides of the border, we share a common language, pop culture, and our business interests cross borders as well.

My prediction is both will come put looking good, without having achieved a great deal."
"Mr. Cunningham, I'm glad the state is finally dealing with one of the drugs that Alaskans abuse to the point of addiction. However, stating that opioids have the same pain killing effectiveness as acetaminophen and ibruprofen is ludicrous.  While I agree that both generics are powerful drugs there is no comparison with opiates if any strength. If you truly believe they're comparable, then opiates should be available over the counter, as Tylenol and Advil are."
Maybe it's time we put user fees up for a vote.
Why a state as huge as Alaska is so close to killing off it's wolf population is unfathamable. The lack of state officials to even pretend to care enough to come up with solutions is deplorable. The only thing they are good at is making excuses. There is no good reason to kill wolves. It's not hunting. People do not survive on their meat. I will never understand what motivates people to slaughter beautiful creatures simply for the thrill of killing.

One might ask: from where, by whom, why? Actually is seems to come from a tradition of the cleric arriving at a great newly built church, built by peons, at their expense and he just takes it over as is his right and might.

"Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was known to be corrupt before ever being named to the post. And now that he’s in the job, he’s enjoying the perks.
Price spent tens of thousands of dollars to take a private jet to travel up and down the East Coast last week.
A private jet to a resort to chat with a pharma CEO sounds like what you might expect from a man who bought stock in a medical company, then authored a bill to boost its value.
But Price’s misuse of a public funds to hire a private plane is particularly egregious, because that Tom Price, is the same Tom Price who railed against government use of private planes.
The ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce committee said he wants to see a “full accounting” of Price’s travel."

Currently there are over 7.5 Billion with another 2 Billion on top of that expected over the next 30 - 35 years - practically all in areas of the planet that can't support them.

... well, ask yourself a second question, was the Canadian article in question sitting beneath a paraphrased version of today's actual headline, as in: 

""Will Liberal Party take long to make Canada less white?""

If that headline above an opinion piece makes you bristle, if that headline seems glaringly offensive, if you are feeling outrage against the words you see in print...

... then ask yourself a third question:

When it comes to opinion pieces, why is the Canadian media so comfortable hurling provocative and pungent spit-balls and molotov cocktails on issues of immigration and race IN AMERICA to provoke stark, uninhibited discussions about race and immigration matters in AMERICA...

... but not comfortable using the same approach with immigration and race matters in Canada?  

It is totally bizarre!"
"There are exclusive cemeteries, but that should change.  There are also large well-kept public cemeteries where all are welcome, while families can choose a religious burial.  Look at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto for example, but there are many others. If our society is designed to 'welcome all', why not cemeteries?  We would not stand for any store, business or restaurant refusing access to a person, based on religion.  Politicians should respect all communities, but not favour one over the other while hoping to attract votes. Let's remember there are many agnostics who have beliefs, but are not necessarily religious, and they don't care who is buried beside them in any cemetery.  We don't need to live 'divided' in life or death."
"Iran has provided the bulk of fighters for Assad, including Hezbollah, Shiite militias from Iraq, recruited Afghan mercenaries from the Afghan refugee population in Iran, as well as it's own IRGC and Quds Force troops. It has lost a significant number of its own soldiers and officers in direct combat and it recruited Russia to enter the war which has indiscriminately bombed civilian targets. But let's take a step back, if Iran had never entered the war on behalf of Assad, it is entirely probable that Assad leaves and the vast majority of the bloodshed is averted in the first place."

You nailed it.
The woman leading the charge to solve the issue never mentioned the true root of the problem.  The  largest portion of the harms from illicit drug use are secondary to our obsession with prohibition.
It is going to get worse before it gets better.
I expect to soon see more designer drugs developed, aiming for incredible potency at minuscule doses. The opioid space is pretty well developed.   Likely next in line will be amphetamine congeners.
Prohibition didn't work with alcohol, and it is not going to work here.  Manufacture, quality control, regulate, and tax is the only adult solution to this problem."
"This is not about the relative dividend yields of the Canadian and US markets. It's about there are more efficient ways to screen for value that dividend screens, and the high current valuations, and therefore lower expected returns, of dividend stocks.

Have a look at the 3 articles linked in the article, which explains it more fully."
"Clearly you have never had any dealings with CRA. In a reassessment CRA can arbitrarily disallow deductions and include income as they see fit.

However, we went for dinner and were very disappointed by the variety and prices on offer.

"Re Gutierrez crime and punishment: on the one hand, you don't want to screw him up for life based on this one crime -  the first one where he was caught. On the other hand you want him to get the message actions have consequences.  I think he would have been a good candidate for caning in lieu of incarceration, in addition to the fines and the community service.  Given that caning may not go over with the American public, I felt the judge came close to the right balance. Except she might have directed he receive some psychiatric counseling.  I prefer caning to incarceration for certain criminals because it gets the person back into society quicker, it costs the state much less to administrate, and it makes an impression on the person."

"Let's be real here. This is happening because a group of citizens ask for the forest service not to destroy/close roads and the forest supervisors position was to state that if roads closures were not allowed the m alheur national forest would not allow timber harvest to take place which meant iron triangle the 70 million dollar benefactor to the ""stewardship"" contract would not see their money paid out. So, since former Grant County court judge Mark Webb has a personal relationship with iron triangle, plus a financial benefit to gather all power to the ""collaborative"" group that pays his wage he, as the executive director decided to work to get the forestry commission disbanded, so his on is justified and he and his friends can have complete control over project development and who gets the pay outs and Mr Webb continues to draw a tidy salary for facilitating the greasing of the tracks.

John Paul II is easily explained by people who thought Vatican II had gone to far. As for Bergolio, if the Masons would be agaisnt anyone, it would be him, unless you are saying that his ideas of universal brotherhood in Christ would somehow gel with the masonic outlook. I can see that, but that is also a scriptural outlook. My-grandfather was a Mason, and I assure you, there is no grand conspiracy. Indeed, it would be nice if Fracis lifted the excommunication, since my mother's family has a long history in the Lodge."

"Just within the last 30 days Trump has cut/harmed various agreements or programs and kicked them to Congress to fix. In each of these cases he's been either an antagonist or, at best, hands off supporting rather than taking a more proactive part.  The most glaring is perhaps ending the DACA program.  He claims he as them ""in his heart"" and ""they'll be fine"" but then treats them like a political bargaining chip for tougher immigration reforms.  Perhaps the best example is with this part of the ACA (not the other EOs such as the one which creates a loophole for insurance companies to ""band"" healthy/lower risk accounts) which he supported, then backed off on.  But the worst has got to be de-certifying the Iran deal when Iran is holding up their end of the deal.  He passed the buck to Congress in a deliberate play to his political base."

"If you believe in science, then i would suspect that you have a good handle on ratios, and statistics as well. You understand that 23% of the world population is Muslim, that's 1.6 billion people compared to 2.2 billion ""Christians"" of varying sects.  It just so happens that the percentage of the worlds population resides in extremely impoverished and violent regions which increases the likelihood of engaging in violent behavior.  The reality is, they could be Budhist and, given the same tumult they are constantly exposed to the results would be the same.  

You might be tempted to say the regions are violent due to the population's religion, but the reality is they have been violent for thousands of years predating the present religions.

It is also socialy acceptable to track and report on violent acts brought on by Muslim individuals and place less emphasis on violence perpetuated by other groups, so there is an inherent bias when it comes to the perception of a violent demographic."

More damning, of course, is the propagandistic narrative so typical of the Globe and other mainstream media.  Why no mention of the support the US, SA, Turkey and Israel have provided to ""rebel"" groups?

She said, ""A good day

She said, ""A bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been.""

One of my dogs, Belle, would lie down with me on bad days, giving me loving care. She knew I was hurting, and did her best to help. I got more help from her than from the VA shrink I saw. At that time, this man's best friend was his dog.

A year or so later, Belle got sick and had to be put down. I held her when the vet gave her the injection. I owed it to her.

Another dog, Madison, liked to get into bed with my wife and me, and have me rub her throat. When I did that, she purred. I've never known any other dog who purred. She stopped doing that after a couple of years. Madison got an aggressive cancer, and on the morning we were going to take her to the vet, she got back in bed with us and purred. She then got off, laid down and died. She was telling us ""adieu""."

"Article is typical liberal pie in the sky…

The issue is that we need to remind our elite deep thinkers about Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as we are stuck on the bottom 2 for most of our citizens.

Let’s get that fixed and let the new Trump team clear up the mess made by unplanned Globalization which by the way caused directly all wars (or conflicts) in the past…  

We can think about bringing the high ideals of liberal democracy out when we are entitled to look at the upper level of Maslow

The new rule of the TRUMP government is lead/follow/or get out of the way…and it’s the right one for now and our government better get with that program and get our pretty boy to start listening to its citizens.

It’s very clear that any interest in these fine ideals about liberal democracy are secondary to the citizens of most western societies until they get their economies and core cultures back in control with strong borders and an environment where the current citizens and children come first"

"I don't agree with your specific list of corrections, but it might be best to permanently freeze real federal spending except to the type of funding the Liberals are offering to mental health & home care to jump start areas of chronic provincial neglect. Frankly, those controlling the spending (the provinces) should be accountable by providing more and more of the funding. The taxpayer is the same regardless, so this whole thing is mostly a provincial charade. This is especially true in the big provinces where they have the scale to manage all of the costs (though for the smaller ones the current funding is likely adequate at currently levels to address that issue. Ontario, Quebec, BC and Alberta have no scale issues."

"I think Russia's view would be rational if there wasn't a history of North Korea progressing for decades towards a competent nuclear weapons capability and their practice of sharing that technology with Iran and other trouble makers.
What Russia and/or China could do is sign a pact with North Korea to come to their defense against enemy attacks and that would eliminate the need of North Korea to have a nuclear weapons arsenal.  But that wouldn't happen because North Korea enjoys the imagery of a world nuclear power.  Their hostile personality and puerile videos of giggling dictator and military generals is scary.  I wouldn't trust them with nuclear weapons and nobody else should.
Why not promise to help them become a world economic power with trade and skills training for the world trade like China has in exchange for nuclear weapons?  China should be able to do this."

ALL invasive species are the result of one primary invasive species that transports them and introduces them into foreign environments.   Animals living in the wild are only doing what they should, and exactly what people also do - find a place to live, try to survive, and want to be left alone to exist and raise their families.  It's interesting that the very people that proclaim this as their own right are the same ones that want to deny it to others.  Now if you want to write an article about controlling the primary invasive species, that would be worth reading."

Even Brian Molefe is trying to influence that.

Zille is defending this - so far it's early days and according to procedure until Maimane jumped the gun (how could he not know the constitution?) - because she's hard-headed and wants to be right, yes, but I suspect more so because her integrity demands it.

On my break, I headed down to the shop, waited in line, and then told them I owed them for a bottle of water.  They were thankful for my honesty but I was amazed that the 5 or 6 people in line behind me all rudely informed me that THEY wouldn't have bothered to come back to pay for a bottle of water.  Even more egregious is the fact that all of those people have to sign an annual ethics agreement at my company to act honestly both in and out of the workplace yet they were all bragging that they would have stolen the water."

"MSW lovingly recounts the memories of fellow hierarchs for John Quinn that they shared at his recent funeral.

Because it insulted the vast majority of hockey playing nations by limiting them to a single team and stealing stars off the elite few who were let in.

"The asylum seekers are illegal immigrants, people whose visas have expired and so forth.  Though the U.S. has always been tough to some extent on these people (I think all kinds of measures were in the works under Obama), the current president is far more vocal about it, and so these illegal immigrants are trying to get into Canada instead.  They are not refugees, they are not fleeing for their lives.  While they may want a better life than in the country of their birth, there's no guarantee they'll actually succeed in Canada. Unlike the immigrants we allow into the country, they're not vetted for the skills required to succeed here.  Nor are we as huge a country as the U.S., with the scope of opportunity there.

We already have massive immigration and a robust refugee system.  I don't think Canadians need to feel that they are cruel and unwelcoming because they don't support opening our borders to the U.S.'s illegal immigrants."

That is no risk of non-payment and knowing exactly when to stop providing any new services to a captive market (they have access to recipients at pay points and via cell phone).

I'm pretty sure this complaint has no significant merit. Janice was invited to be at this Council meeting and present her qualifications and her passion to be appointed to the vacant Council seat.
