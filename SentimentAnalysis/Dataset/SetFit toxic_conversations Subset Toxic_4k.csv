"stop making excuse for your infantile and stupid behavior.  there are ways to express your displeasure but showing your finger is not one of these ways.  you have disrespected the process and brought shame to the Hawaii delegation and people.   you owe the people of Hawaii an apology and to the DNC.  If you refuse to apologize then you should resign your position with the Hawaii democratic party.  there is no bravery involved just plain stupidity.   you are stooping low like trump is doing in his immature behavior when people disagree with him.   maybe you should join the repubs, you should feel at home with them.  dems do not tolerate stupidity.   no fd, she does not love Hawaii, she lovers herself, if she did she would not have done what she did to bring shame to us."

"Kumbya is greek, use a Kappa. Cumbya is a term used at those Vatican gay orgies. Regardless, I am not arguing for a kumbya moment. Quite a few priests need to be be outed, not as gay, but as asexuals, and counseled on what their sexuality entails and how it has preverted Catholic sexual teaching. They need to feel as uncomforatable with that as they have made the rest of us feel for normal heterosexuality."

"I see the Corrupt Bastards Club is still on course with the Taj Mahawker II, with the original Taj Mahawker issue, complete with the crooks who colluded with our so-called 'representatives, still facing lawsuits and misdirection in the continued attempt to fleece the public of massive amounts of ca$h.

November election is almost here. Throw these thieves OUT. Everyone who was involved with this outright theft and mismanagement of public funds, throw them OUT. No matter if they have a D, R, or I after their name, throw them OUT. The people involved with this larcenous act need to be prosecuted and jailed. Mark Pfeffer and Bob Acree should be charged under federal racketeering laws and sued down to their socks. Hawker and company should be similarly stripped of every dime and jailed.

"He suffered such a massive bankruptcy ten years or so ago that he is legally able to write down his income taxes for years into the future. Sort of the shill game going on with the oil companies on the north slope. They get to go into the out years with deductions that are not taken this year on work done this year. Lobbyists, lawyers and campaign contributions determine who pays and who plays. Trump is a player not a payer. Paying taxes is for the stupid people like you and me."
The use of that language is used to illustrate how stupid this non-issue is.
Still think Trump is stupid? He's split the country East vs. West and put tariffs and countervailing duties on some of our largest exports. Say what you want but he does understand business.
I am guessing that Pence and his boss don't like Hawaii after the local federal judge blocked their Muslim ban. The lei represents everything about Hawaii and Pence didn't want to keep it longer than he had to. Just a way to show his contempt for the Hawaiians.
"Statues are for heroes. When you erect statues of villains you glorify their accomplishments as heoic. The primary accomplishment of the confederacy and its leaders who are now enshrined in statuary around the South was to secede and start a civil war with America for the purpose of retaining slavery against an entire race. By glorifying that, those who erected and those who support them today are tacitly stating that if we had our way we would again endeavour to return to those days of total white race dominance. Of course we can't, so we have these statues in our public places to tell the world what we still believe in. These bigoted white supremacists who took up arms in the name of slavery are our heroes. Surely the southern states have other truly noble humanitarian heroes who's stories would be better told in the public parks throughout the south than these abhorrent symbols of apartheid and racial cruelty."
"The only thing wrong with your projection Icon666 is that so far ...:

Nothing goes to the heart of our system of government than this fraud you all sat around and pretended wasn't happening ...Pathetic!
2) No racist events have been tied to either Trump or the GOP ...and as a matter of fact it's the democrats who have the long and storied history of racism ..not the GOP. Filibustered any civil rights acts lately?

Foolish reply. Trump deliberately avoided endorsing Article 5 in order to bring about the response which he has now seen - from Germany and now from Canada.

He is guilty of numerous criminal acts that he should have been impeached for and wasn't. Obama wasn't just a member of the left wing progressive clown car crowd...he was their king.

If we really want to be serious about the problem of blacks being killed why is there no mention of the black-on-black killings daily in Chicago? We don't hear about it because it doesn't fit the left's narrative.

I'm sick of hearing the BLM mantra. Black lives are no more important than any other lives, so quit using a phrase the left designed around a false narrative.

This poor, young black man has bought into the lies that are determined to create chaos and widen the racial divide. Nothing positive will come of it."

The words that come to mind are evil, cowardly, self-serving, stupid, moronic, did I say self-serving? I have never met a group of people who care less about the people that they ""represent"" (Alaskans) and who openly, happily live in the pockets of their benefactors (oil companies and other filthy rich corporations and individuals). The author is exactly right - bright, innovative people will not move to Alaska if the schools are bad and we NEED these kinds of people to build a new, vibrant economy. Ignorant Alaskans say things like, ""if they don't want to live here, we don't need 'em"". You are WRONG! We need all the brainpower we can get to solve our fiscal issues. Clearly the morons in the Senate are not, and have never been, up to the task. They should be ashamed. They are absolutely disgusting."
"Unless you have some proof that Trump was in the KKK, then you are a horrible person for making an accusation like that.

If you are against the historic home exemption then why have I NEVER seen or heard of you speak out against it except when talking about Kirk. So it sounds like you are just anti-Kirk and use any red herring. 

Your line ""he somehow managed..."" is a sad and pathetic attempt to try and sling mud at Kirk. That is NO WAY for a former Governor to act - you should be ashamed of this. I would hope you would lift the conversation but time and time again I and many others are disappointed by your behavior on-line and in the real world."
"Pay your fair share of taxes for what, so that all of the out of state businesses can send the profits made here in this state somewhere else. Government positions will be cut but until now that was one of the ways to get the oil money infused back into the economy. Since we have no IRS up here to help get the oil money back into the system, paying government employees provided a way. Also the government providing money for projects that unions worked on was another way and essentially made union employees into government employees. Since Alaska really has no exports, oil was what provided the income, 95% of the budget that paid everybody and probably 90% went to businesses that shipped the profits out of state ultimately.
One might think that all of the people up here, whatever group would work together to quell the money drain. Our biggest export is money. Everybody provides a function that is needed to keep the state going and this bickering and wasting time is plain stupidity."

"No, Canada and Mexico should not walk away from negotiations.

"It's so telling to see Alaska republicans and especially our congressional delegation rally around the ludicrous candidacy of Donald Trump.

"Canada cannot be neither bullied nor tamed by a terminal addiction to tweets galore.

"Igl shows a gross ignorance of Oregon 1920's history by writing ""Support for Prohibition, not racism or anti-Catholicism, was probably the No. 1 issue of the 1920s KKK.. Crain wrote of Eugene Klan members in Oct. 26, 1922: “They joined without knowledge of the dangerous nature of the organization .. they joined what they thought to be a patriotic fraternity.""
From the Oregon gubernatorial election, 1922 Wikipedia entry ""In the early 1920's the Klan had become a powerful political force in Oregon. Ben Olcutt (the current Republican governor from 1919) refused to endorse the Klan. Olcutt's actions nearly cost him the Republican nomination to the Klan backed candidate..The Klan threw their support behind Democrat Walter Pierce who also backed the Klan's Compulsory Education Act..a deliberate attack on Roman Catholic private schools. Both Pierce and the education initiative won wide victories in Nov. 1922""  In 1925 the US Supreme Court struck down the Klan backed Oregon education act."

Back when the conservative, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing,  government in France (and the Socialist/Green one in Germany) was trying to keep the U.S. from its demented illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq, nitwits passed around a very stupid, fake story supposedly about an American admiral who was invited to a posh fest in Paris. I received it repeatedly.

When someone complained about the U.S. intent, ""he"" supposedly said, ""If it wasn't for the U.S., you'd all be speaking German now."" 

Then, it claimed, ""The room fell silent.""

I responded to this ignorant, ""feelgood"" chain letter by writing to all the senders and everyone they'd copied:

"That's contradicted by the facts. First of all, Democrats have acknowledged the past and the party evolved to the anti-racist side, which prompted southern racists who used to constitute the Solid South for the party to migrate to the GOP, where the South now pretty much votes solidly for Republicans due to the GOP's adoption of the racist polices the Democrats used to push. If there are any remaining racists in the Democratic Party, the members will marginalize and push them out.

The Democratic Party of the 1800s, though, was the conservative party. They were not ""leftist"" at all.

Entitlements are not ""slavery."" That's just a silly remark, pre-packaged propaganda to demonize people who need help. Look at Ben Carson -- on public assistance and loans and public housing all his life until he made it on his own, and now he demonizes welfare. Bunch of hypocrites."

"In 1970 if Alaskans fully understood what HYDROGEN is then TAPS would have been a big stupid gas-pipeline instead of a horrid CRUDE-pipe.

In 1971 when I was standing in Atigun Pass before a road was built thru the pass, silently alone with the wind in my ears, I knew the thundering stampede yet to arrive was focused on CRUDE without a broad education in energy architecture.

CRUDE is a messy goop stuck halfway between COAL & METHANE.

IMHO:  CRUDE has less value than properly processed COALwater [LRCWF].

Wasting our gas to produce CRUDE is like wasting all the gold&copper to produce the molybdenum in a big metalliferous porphyry.

A big stupid $65billion gas pipeline looks more like a bank robbery than an efficiently designed gas development project.

We can begin developing our gas-resources with very little CAPEX-risk,

The Paris Accord has no, repeat, no penalties for not following the terms of the Accord.  It's an honor system.  Can you believe it?  An honor system!

And Fox, Breitbart, etc. treat Trump like he can do no wrong. That has more to do with Trump's poll numbers than anything else. In the meantime, the really dangerous thing is that the press has destroyed its credibility with this. You do realize, don't you, that the press is trusted by less than 35% of the country? This is a historic low. Disney and ESPN squandered public attention to football, Hollywood is viewed as a collection of spoil lunatics and narcissistic sex addicts, and the Democratic Part is held in such low esteem that they couldn't get a candidate elected dog catcher in most of the country.

The typical delusion of the stupid and blind ideologues of the Trump mentality. Without government spending nothing in this nation would be functioning. You believe you are some Aryan super being devoid of any responsibility for any part of society except your own selfish interests. The Nazi/Fascist/White Supremacist ideology devoid of any humanity or conscience. Crawl back into your bunker you evil bastard.
The Con-conservative party of Canada are anal retentive hard asses. Not a tittle of compassion on the part of anyone. Mean-spirited con-con hypocrites.  Gloating and smirking with their pasted on smiles. Ha! Viva Justin Trudeau.
"Is it not completely obvious to everyone that this woman is mentally ill?  I mean she needs to seek qualified help, maybe spend a little time in a mental ward under some supervision.   Add the rest of the idiots who voted for her please.   She is clearly about to have a mental breakdown every time she speaks she is about to fold.  Shameful behavior and her actions on the MCB are reprehensible.   Get rid of this shameful nutcase or you are doomed to have her idiocy repeated."
"Trump is a racist,
…and a petty con man,
…and a traitor.
But back to the racist part.
That's what attracted so many of his supporters.
There is no longer any doubt that Mueller's office is investigating Trump for collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation,
…it's just a matter of time now.
Being rid of the racists in the White House will go a long ways to making all the other racists scurry back under their rocks where they belong."
"My advice is to stand back, Roach.

The splatter off of Trump is going to hit a lot of people.

I can only hope it was someone blowing off fireworks that got shot.
"Jim Colver is alright. George Rauscher, who the Republican blogger Susanne Downing described as the Deputy Mayor of Sutton will say anything. Sutton is not an incorporated city and probably never will be. So he isn't a Mayor of any kind. Rauscher is more of the same old same old tired blithering repubo from the Mat-Su. A vote for him keeps this failed status quo going. Rauscher for State House/Ridiculous."
"Ahhhhh Lordy............more muslim victimhood crap.  They are victims of their own ideology, period.  To defend your country is a hate crime?  Reality check.......Canada is fast becoming an islamic satellite, thanks to our spineless politicians.   Why are progressives in such a hell-bent-for-leather hurry to defend that which is indefensible?  They are ashamed of our country and the values that true Canadians have fought and died for.  This is truly sickening."

"Keillor hints at what is missing:  who in Scab Holler, Kentucky really gives a tinkers dam about what happens in a city which  you  can only enjoy it if you are relatively wealthy,  like Keillor,  who made his dough producing a  great program for Public Radio.  Irony at its best.  

In Scab Holler,  Junior  died of an opiate overdose,  a teenage girl is preggers.    Grandpa is hocking up his black lungs,  and dad left years ago for Somewhere,  Indiana.  The week the debit card gets filled by the state is the best of every month.  The white trash majority  voted for Trump and their erstwhile ""friends"" in the Democrat party are doing their best to re rig their rigged election,  which was lost by a lazy candidate too old to serve at full capacity.  Karma bit the Democrat butt.  They threw a pair of large panties and a bra out to the voters,  and lost.   Irony.

While the media and many with no sense whatsoever have been obsessing on All Things Russia, the President and his cabinet have actually been accomplishing all kinds of things toward the goal. This nonsense needs to end soon, as it has been a huge waste of time and U.S. tax payers money. #Shame"
"So, Margaret, do you get tired of having to include the de riguer concessions about how Trump is awful this or really bad that?  I know I find them tedious to read."
May be the best way to protest against all of this is to stop paying taxes? Interesting how would government react if thousands of Canadians refused to pay taxes. Why should we pay for such idiotic policies and plans.

Christians still hold the record for the worlds worst atrocities and most people killed, and killed in the name god, during their Holy War, which somehow they managed to flip onto Muslims, by claiming Jihad means Holy War, which it doesn't.  Christians are also labeled the most ignorant people in the world and most unaware of reality. Although I can't imagine why! Clearly that isn't true... :/"
"Two Federal jury verdicts involving black plaintiffs in the same week here in Eugene.

I will always disagree with Judge McShane's gay marriage decision, primarily because he is a gay man in a relationship and could have recused himself.  

But he certainly isn't a right-wing racist nut job.  

I'm betting his dismissal of the race card charges stands, even in the 9th Circuit.

Here is yesterday's 9th Circuit case  involving police a Taser, a death and a crazy person.

It is the left that bankrupts small business people if they don't bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple even though such a ""marriage"" was uninmaginable 20 years ago.

"What the goofball leftwing journalists/editors who wrote this article don't understand is that it's not so much whether Trump's products are manufactured here in the U.S. as it is that Trump and a Republican Congress are willing to create an environment with less taxes and regulations that make the United States a country that is more attractive for businesses to set up their base, grow and thrive.

The oil companies gave this money to the state as a rainy day fund, it is raining!!

The Saudis  plan of attack is working, just look at this foolish HB 247!! 

The staged panic will cause bad decisions, that is what they count on!  Saudi Arabia wants everyone and Alaska to shut down or slow oil production! 

This is why the young Saudi Prince Salman flooded the oil markets with a glut to gut Alaska and other foolish producers that fall prey to a old trick!

But they have a real issue with someone who distributes dividends (from a company he/she built) to family members all the while employing other Canadians in meaningful work. My god!!! What is the world coming to???? Canada just can not stand for these fair share hogging types. It is just not Canadian.

This too smells like a smokescreen to take the attention off of Pebble where still another Canadian company wants to dig and take out more Alaskan gold and resources. Is Alaska and it's people so stupid that they aren't getting the picture. Do we initiate taxes so that we can pay for this robbery?"

It's way past time to take a long hard look at your own party, put on your big boy pants, and accept your loss like a man."
"Once again you prove you don't know what your talking about . Garbage collector's have to have a CDL . To get a CDL you have to pass a written and driving test. There's no way to pass those without an education which is needed to pay the written test . Oh , and you also have to pass a medical test and random drug tests --which would eliminate perhaps 75 percent of young people in today's society .  Having an education opens the doors of life to everyone. Crying wolf every year like the NEA and ASD does by passing out layoff's they KNOW aren't going to happen is dishonest to taxpayers and those getting the notices .The Dispatch working hand in hand with the NEA and ASD to create this false narrative every year like clockwork is shameful.  You can only cry wolf so many times before people stop believing you.  Watch for this same thing to happen next spring.  The only difference may be that the Dispatch may not be around to help the unions and democrats next spring---if we are lucky ."
"Each man (or, theoretically, at least) woman who becomes President bring with him/her a lifetime of experience, a worldview, a set of knowledge and wisdom, and a set of values.  The Office of President doesn't ""erase"" the persona of the occupant, it reflects it.

You reference to ""Trump the man rather than Trump the President"" is wholly illogical. The very problem with ""Trump the President"" is he is, in fact, ""Trump the Man.""  As I have often suggested, IMO, Trump the Man, as reflected in every facet of his life, meets the qualifications of a sociopath.  He is now President and, guess what, his actions continue to be consistent with those of Trump the (sociopathic) Man.  It would be foolish to expect anything else. 

 It is a cliche', (most cliche's have a large element of turth. that's why they're cliche's) but the best predictor of FUTURE behavior is PAST behavior.  Look at Trump's long and infamous personal, business and now political life. (cont)"

They even refuse the cost savings that would come from putting the U of A administration in one location.

"Trump's considers fulfillment of his own ego more important than integrity of any election. He would lead this country toward his own brand of Banana Republic. He would cite evidence of 10 votes in 3 million as reason to disenfranchise  millions of voters across this country by disallowing students to vote where they live and disallowing many forms of ID in favor of gun permit IDs. in other words tilting the elections in an aggressive way that includes outrageous gerrymandering and election fraud.

I was a total tomboy as a child, long enough ago that we can't blame the current toxic environment for it, and thank god I had a mother and family that accepted me for who I was. I wasn't forced to wear stupid frilly dresses and play with stupid frilly dolls and stupid frilly girls. Instead hung out with my brother and his friends, climbed trees, etc, and was accepted as one of them. And while I had to endure a hell of a lot of teasing, that was probably more to do with my advanced vocabulary than my tomboyishness. 

I grew out of it, as will most boys and girls if they are accepted and loved, but if I hadn't, I know that my family would have still accepted me, and that family love and acceptance is what helped me overcome not only the horrible bullying I endured, but sexual assault, too. 

No amount of being forced to be a ""girly girl"" would have done that for me."

You parasites have killed the host
Socialism causes fat people because the nanny state does everything so these morons can't even make their own smart decisions anymore. Stop making their decisions. You are killing them.

"It would be nice if the Canadian media would ease up on Trump coverage, its becoming a bore and is mostly repetitious anyway.

"""The March 6 order called for a 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees to enable the government to implement stronger vetting procedures.""
Okay, fine. The Trump administration claimed they needed between 90 and 120 days to ""enable them to implement stronger vetting procedures"". 
But.... they've been in power well over the time they say they needed, so why haven't they actually implemented stronger vetting procedures? The court bans did nothing that prevented the government from implementing them. Nothing. So obviously that was not the reason for the attempted temporary bans.
Obviously the Trump gang lied or they're merely incompetent. Which do you think it is?"
"re:  Everyone who owns a house has benefited from idiotic rises in housing prices

The cbc anchor was clearly disappointed when Notley didn't entertain the narrative that it was ""oil workers"", portrayed like the first X-Men movie in terms of backwoods northern Alberta cage fighters.  Canada has over one hundred billion dollars of projects on hold due to the vocal minority of job-killing professional protesters. Career activists have turned into a national liability - Canada has the ""stuff"" the rest of the world needs and our biggest impediment to progress is domestic Naomi Klein-style hypocrites. When a vocal minority of ignorant blowhards can hijack the discussion on nation-building projects, it's a sign of regression as a society.

"Greg, Let's turn your statements around to reflect the truth. If Josh and groups like his didn't block forest management for profit at every turn, but instead support and encourage sound forest management, only then would this be a non-issue. They have actually aided in creating ecosystems that /are/ in balance and healthy, as opposed to those that have been clear cut, allowing erosion of healthy soils and sediment to clog otherwise clear streams. Fire is Nature's mechanism to manage and propagate healthy forests; allowed to do so naturally, there wouldn't be the out-of-control wildfire situation we have today. While I can't speak for Josh, I suspect many members of wildlife organizations do not oppose hunting for sustenance (but certainly not for just the pure sport of it).

You hate that I know exactly who you are.  Of course you want me to be nice, but I'm not nice to racists and nazis like you.

"To you doting Hillary supporters I respect your views, as convoluted as they are. However here is a Wikipedia link for you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations In the second paragraph it says factually and I quote from Wikipedia ""Of all the allegations made against him regarding his sexual history, Clinton has only admitted extramarital relationships with Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers, although he settled the suit brought by Paula Jones for $850,000. He denied having an affair with Dolly Kyle."" and this is whitewashed! Nonetheless he did settle for $850k. That's a lot for just an 'extra-marital' affair isn't it? Now the rapist that he certainly is, Mr. Bill Clinton will again reside in the White House if you libs can find out how to steal the election. 
And how about the rapist that victimized a 12 year old girl in 1975 that Hillary subsequently defended, got off on a technicality, and later laughed about it. She also blamed the victim!"

You don't run a trail with an ipod in your ears when you know there are bear in the area.  You certainly don't run or hike where you know there are salmon spawning this time of year. I lived around brown bears in the bush in southeast for seven straight years.  Close proximity, even walking up to the dump to put trash in while 3 were laying only 25 feet away and nothing happened, they didn't even move.  I knew how to behave around them and how to act.  More people need to learn how to behave in bear country and there would be less attacks, less maulings.  Stupidity will get you killed in Alaska and this advice is for all the lower 48rs who have moved here and for those who come to visit.  Brown bears are not something to fear, they are beautiful animals and just need their space."

"Political motivations, and parties aside. I would love to know peoples actual thoughts on this. Good. Bad? Could we actually get bipartisan support or is it a pipe dream. 

Additionally, the idea of a high speed transit in the windsor to toronto, and maybe in the future toronto to montreal corridors (which is like half of Canada's population) is one that may be interesting. There isn't much debate that infrastructure like this can massively foster growth along the route, but there is also the price factor. People don't like it in their backyard. 

Also, since this will be costly regardless, I would be curious price comparisons between HSR and Maglev. Mostly because the latter is more expensive but will require reduced maintenance costs whilst also having the advantage of being far quieter, likely reducing ""NIMBY"" BS. Not to mention it would be a great selling point of ""hey, look at our futuresque shit that travels at speeds that rival planes""."

I actually feel bad for those who voted with 'bald faced stupidity' because they will certainly reap the consequences of that stupidity.  Trump will turn on them because even his blinded ego is beginning to process the fact he is not liked at all by over half the country.

John would do well to step back and analyze what occurred in order for someone such as Trump to win the office. He touches on a wake up call but it was far more than that. It has exposed the dirty laundry of both parties, one more than the other via volume. Russia didn't decide this, middle America did.

As an unscientific, molehill stamping, straw man builder I'll simply focus on my own references for what feels right or wrong and continue to do what I have since January 2011. 

It appears that there is not one thing that I've said or written with which you have even a slight inclination to agree. I respectfully (sans any sarcasm) concede that I can't find any common ground with you and based on the last few days have no cause to believe I ever will. I'm dumbfounded (you probably have a label for that state too) that (in your view) I can be so wrong all of the time."
"Sneaky rat editor is pulling some crap on me. Here it is:
What the...did I pick up the wrong paper? An article not bashing America on the opinion page? I declare that a first in this paper's history. There's always a dig against patriots somewhere.

Equating the ability to deal with pain with your stature in society is a BS game that adults play with children, even when if it was you with the bad enough scraped knee you would be at the hospital asking for pain killers, or do you think it is the kids that are hooked on opiates?"

"Count this Ivy League grad as anti-intellectual.  In the US, with more and more people going to college, we have more and more stupid people thinking that they are smart.    They seem to think that sitting through a bunch of lectures, particularly those in the social sciences, by ""those who teach"" and memorizing their propaganda raises them to a different level of social status, smarter than others.  

But what's a shame is how part of the brainwashing makes them speak differently, putting on airs, to make themselves sound smarter than they really are.  They're human computers, programmed by elitist professors to turn people into wanna-be intellectuals; still unable to think, just regurgitating the memory from their hard drives.

Look at the whole climate change fiasco: no one dare question the (crap) data analysis, because, you know, it was generated and analyzed by scientists who went to college and became smart just like they did.  Meanwhile, many shunned science courses as too hard"

I have no idea how you fools could be a part of any religion that has so much hatred and ugliness attached to it.  Your Christian religion promotes this hatred.  It singles people out as being 'sinful' and not following YOUR god's demands.  YOUR hateful god, I will add.  Believe what you want, since all that hatefulness and and all those lies have been indoctrinated in you probably since your Sunday school days.  That's YOUR belief. Leave people alone.

"Puberty blockers are not ""irreversible."" Kids take them under medical supervision and if the kids decide they're not TG, they just stop taking them and puberty proceeds. However, if they ARE transgender, this gives them an opportunity to avoid a puberty that would be distressing for them and allows them a chance to express the gender they experience. Surgery performed in accordance with the ""standards of care"" for transgender people would only happen when the patient is old enough to give consent (so no kids) and their medical team (including mental health professionals) agree that it is appropriate.

This ranks well above Watergate and should see Obama/Clinton reduced in public opinion to the likes of McCarthy.

I found Netanyahu's American accent to be obnoxious because he wasn't American. Like a double-agent in a spy film. As we stagger into disaster, I think Americans will start thinking the same thing because of the the swagger in his step. Macho man.  I truly don't think a lot of people know this, but Israel borders Syria - the land that has been savaged by its own leader and his opponents.

the command to make war on all the infidels (9:123) and subjugate the entire world to Allah (9:33).

"""As any substantial award would have done, the Khadr settlement establishes an incentive for others to take serious risks (i.e. joining terrorist organizations abroad)...""

Several commentators, including myself, have raised the obvious solution which would eliminate incentives, liabilities, etc.:  When Canadians choose to leave the country to kill our troops and our allies, then by default they should lose their citizenship, period.  You can't fight against the flag and then hide behind its protections.  We're idiots for even having allowed it.

So far, I have not seen one cogent counter-argument to this suggestion.  I see a lot of blaming of previous governments and lectures about the constitutional rights of our citizens.  But these arguments would be moot had the Kadrs lost their citizenship when they left the country to pursue jihad against us.

"But why stay within an organization he doesn't believe in and finds corrupt?

For example lets say he joined to serve the army or work at Lockheed and Martin, becomes disenchanted with it, decides to be a pacifist, where is the logic of a pacifist staying in the army?

Another example someone joins the communist party, lives as a capitalist and dislikes communism but refuses to dissociate himself as a communist despite his disdain for the ideology.

A guy gets a job with British petroleum or shell, decides he cares about the environment 

Or a man joins an organization, finds out they are a self serving, exclusive enclave of hypocrites, why stay?

I don't get it, I don't get why someone who dislikes X and disbeliefs Y would stay within a group that promotes X and believes Y.

"Oh, right--because a president who is a womanizer, commits adultery with an intern in the oval office, sexually harasses women as president, tries to use his office to bully the women into silence, then lies about it under oath, claiming not to know the definition of ""is"" has integrity and character than is beyond reproach.  

The person who is married to him, who says that women who claim harassment and abuse should be believed---but did not believe the several women who accused her husband and likewise tried to bully them into silence also has integrity and character that is beyond reproach.  

Dude, seriously?

I grant Trump is no integrity or character--but what politician does?  You don't get to be a high level politician like a senator, president, SCOTUS justice etc, if you have integrity and character!  I accept that.  If you are going to throw stones at Trump, make sure you save some for Slick Willy and his wife.   They are no better."

"You say ""nonsense"" to verifiable facts? You can look up the Trump U fraud trial (remember when Trump the xenophobe said Judge Curiel's Mexican ancestry prevented him from judging the case?) Verifiable. You can look up the fact that Donald and Ivanka's elitist ties, shirts, handbags, shoes, etc. are manufactured overseas, not in America. This isn't a matter of belief or opinion. Look at the label on your Trump tie. Verifiable. It's verifiable, not believe or opinion, that Trump bought Chinese steel for his buildings. It's verifiable that Trump has filed BKY multiple times, leaving small contractors and investors on the hook. It's verifiable that Trump has stiffed small contractors, refused to pay them and told them to take him to court, knowing he could bleed them with legal costs. He has spent his life in court. He is litigious and he's only out for himself. He's a con man and only the most gullible of rubes still believe his cons. Congrats on that Trump U ""diploma"" though. LOL."

Yesterday I saw a widely spread video of Muslims attacking a Christmas tree at a mall. ""Deport these devils!"" was the gist of the comments. Hilariously, the video is actually a traditional tree climbing race of the Christian Kurds, filmed in Iraq, but the Trumpies see a few hijabs and assume it is violent mob (never mind that many in the crowd were wearing Santa hats). This is the kind of unchallenged dumbness that works to win an election but not in governance."

He's already put us in deficit by 3-times his promise and reneged on many of his election promises. He's not even close to the intellectual capacity, political smarts and experience of Chretien, who didn't make it 12-years. Study your political history, fanboy."
Lots of the run up in the markets were based on the hope of a trillion dollar infrastructure promise and the tax reform promise. He did not talk or give any details about that yesterday. I expect  the tax reform part to be executed (because the Replublicans want it) but the infrastructure spending will be a challenge(most republicans dont want it). He talked about building his stupid wall and repealing Obamacare. Both of which does not help the Markets or the dollar.

Where's his outrage for the honor killings, female genital mutilation.
His refusal to identify islamic terrorism by it's name speaks volumes of hypocrisy."

I know a President can only do so much, but, face it, there have been no great Legislative victories since he became POTUS? And you can only blame the RINOS so much. He'd better get Taxes, the border Wall and this DACA thing right or he'll lose my support and tens of millions of other decent hard working Americans who put him in there. Let's stop blaming the media, too. They've always sucked. Trump won with all those arseholes all lined up against him. What does that tell y'all? Lets be honest, there may come a time when we'll have to put the blame where it really belongs, right in his lap. But I pray that doesn't happen. AMEN"

"There's something that needs to happen before we start talking about removing contraception from the ""sin list."" The Catholic teaching magisterium must finally acknowledge that sex isn't only about conceiving a child. This is almost acknowledged every time old infertile people marry in the church. I once asked a priest why the church would marry people who are clearly beyond their child-bearing years and do you know what he said, ""to allow for a miracle."" I kid you not. Seems to me if God can create a miracle and suddenly make an old woman fertile again s/he should be able to make a lesbian pregnant from, I don't know, the Holy Spirit? Or perhaps a gay man will miraculously be able to bear a child in a womb that God could suddenly create in him. But no, that would be foolish so we can't allow gay sex. Getting past that barrier would also remove masturbation from the sin list and also allow every straight couple to enjoy sex without worry. But I'm not holding my breath waiting for that."

"When armed  White Supremacists and Neo Nazi hate groups descended on Charlottesville Trump didn’t immediately  call them out as bigots and racists. He was essentially silent because these people are part of his base.  Time went by and at the prodding of his advisors he gave a half hearted condemnation from a teleprompter. Later,  when given the opportunity to speak his mind on the subject he  basically undercut his previous remarks by stating that there were “very fine people” among the racists. He didn’t call these hate mongers “sons of bitches” or call for their employers to “fire” them."
"Even attempting to use the word 'factual' in a theological discussion is ludicrous!

The Catholics will be surprised to discover that they are not Christians.  You would think that the guy buried in the Vatican would have some slight claim to be a follower of Christ, at least.  Not to mention the one supposedly buried in St. Mark's in Venice.  

All the ""Pieces of the True Cross"" and most of the other Saints' relics scattered about Europe are most likely bogus, but there seems to be at least some contemporary history for those two.

Whether Catholics are Christian illustrates the problem.  

Theology and doctrine define a 'Christian'.   Then you kill eight million people in the Thirty Years War to make sure that your definition is followed.

380 years later, you want to reopen those wounds and kill off the Catholics because they are not Christians, I guess."

The North Koreans have every right to run their country their own way so long as they do not act irresponsibly by extending their violence beyond their borders. If the North Koreans begin making serious acts of aggression, only then do we have the right to intervene with our military. Trump must stop provoking them with his veiled threats, and they will leave the rest of us alone. Trump is a dangerous psychopath who is emotionally unstable.

There is within Buddhist teaching a difference between compassion and what is known as idiot compassion.

There are a lot of areas in university which are very disproportionately female, and nobody seems to care about that. But let there be one which is disproportionately male and the social justice warriors are on the march! Hey, here's an idea. We FORCE young women to enter sciences whether they want to or not. We choose their career path and make them follow it. That way the number of women in science programs will be equal to the number of men, and then you can appoint equal numbers! 

Of course, the more likely alternative is they'll just find some incompetents and appoint them solely based on their gender. Then our glorious science minister - who only got her job due to her womb - will be able to act like she's accomplished something great - just like the girlyman who appointed HER."

Not many pension funds are making their target yields in recent years, and there is no indication this is going to change in the foreseeable future. Some countries actually have negative interest rates on their bonds, and in recent years stocks aren't much better.  30 year US obligations are at 2.3% and you can get a home loan at 3.5% so why is the State satisfied paying 4%.

"Sorry, your assumption is incorrect.  If guns are not used, then knives, hammers, axes, cars, vans, trucks etc will be used.  Not having a gun has not stopped the Islamic Jihadis from killing has it?  And in fact, I would say that they especially enjoy killing with knives and swords.
Before guns, swords, spears, axes,  knives, bow and arrows were very effective means of killing and just as deadly as guns."
"I despise our liar-in-chief, but I agree with him on ""some"" issues. This poll is nonsense, because that does not make me, or anyone else, a supporter of Trump.

TSA would not be needed if you use K-9 units but muslims claim it's wrong for you to use a dog to search them, claiming by religious right you cannot touch or approach them with an unclean/filthy animal.

"Both of those were a long time ago; the World has changed, and, stupid lefty, I don't fit any of your stereotypes about guns, gold, or Bibles.   Lefty and smart are not synonyms.   Now let's see what my alleged ""peers"" think about that."
"Kids do dumb things.  The problem with the digital age is those mistakes can be global in under an hour.  I personally think like crossing the street, parents need to educate their children much better about the dangers of the internet, especially sending pictures of yourself out.  No one should send out naked pictures of themselves, it's a really bad idea.  These boys took advantage of naive younger girls."
"Old, white, male, impotent, finished."
"Agreed. But lets also give accuracy some due here. Pope Francis has removed many priests, bishops and Cardinals over this issue. He laicized Josef Wesolowski in 2014 and put him on trial in 2015 in front of the Vatican Tribunal. In 2014 again in his own backyard in Argentina he laicized Jose Mercau who was convicted and pled guilty to sex abuse charges. 

He has also done the same actions when it comes to bishops and cardinals such as defrocking in 2013 Luis Bambaren who was the former head of Perus Conference of Catholic Bishops and just recently his removal of Cardinal Mueller as the Vatican's doctrine chief which is significant because it was Mueller as head of the CDF who stonewalled a lot of the abuse commissions proposals. 

So Pope Francis deserves legitimate criticism on not issues such as not ending the Pontifical Secret or changing Canon Law on this issue of sex abuse. But saying he's trying to protect child rapists is not one of them."
"Yes putting your company in bankruptcy and not paying all smaller vendors so they also default clearly shows how Trump ""gets it"". He gets it - but his definition of that word is not to give a crap about anyone but himself. His mouth talks but his action speaks......"
It's always the doctors (like the teachers and public servants) who go militant when you try to crimp their cushy pay and lifestyle and undermine what little respect is left for their profession. Greed and entitlement is all this is. Ask any one of them to justify what they do for the avg $400K a year that a smidgen of intelligence and google can't do. What accountability do they have for the salary they draw and how can they justify tax breaks for them and not the rest of taxpayers? They get paid even when they kill their patients right? I don't recall hearing there is a need to do a good job to get paid. Sad state of medicine in Canada. Just another group of lazy entitled greedy unioners.

"Sounds like American history ended in the 1950s. 

Its laugh out loud hilarious to listen to a republican give a party history lesson...they always skip over the part where all the Dixiecrats and a whole bunch of other Democrats changed parties in the 60s. because Republicans opposed the voting rights and civil rights acts and the Democratic party mostly supported both. It isn't revisionist history, its history elimination.

No thinking person falls for this nonsense...but its pathetic that some republican still try to push the con. The republican party has for the better part of 2 generations been the comfortable home of the most bigoted and racist among us...and on that point there is no debate."

"Regarding: ""Assaults on Muslim women force some to rethink hijab""
- Sadly assaults triggered by issues of ethnic origin or by evidence of religious faith (such as a cross, or an hijab) occur world wide.
- Currently in Europe, especially in countries who have opened their borders to refugees (a great many of whom are Muslim from worn torn  countries) women, especially those not obviously Muslim are facing concerns of assault and rape by young men who are from countries routinely considered Muslim countries.
- The solution to violence must needs be a global solution. 
- Leaders of Christian churches and of the various Muslim communities need to address this violence as a civil society / commonweal issue and as a faith issue. That is christian and muslim communities and the civil governments must emphatically declare on all accounts that any violence is not supported by Christianity or by Islam or by civil law and in no way do those of good will support the perpetrators of said violence."

It's profoundly degrading, arrogant, condescending, male, psychotic, and immoral. Only a credulous fool would be taken in by their skin-crawlingly farcical false manipulative school of politics at this point.

People who defend them out themselves as fascist in predilection, be that spiritual, material, social, or cultural. At the end of the day, they basically hate gender equity.

"Trump quotes on nuclear war:

“I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.”


Last August on television speaking with a foreign policy expert, repeatedly asked “why can’t we use nuclear weapons.”


TRUMP: I think — I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me.


Trump is a weak and insecure neurotic fraud.  He's mentally incompetent and unfit for office

He and his effeminate, white supremacist, neoNazi sidekicks need to be removed from the White House."
"Actually, three lying senators lost their seats.  The Hideous Hudak had to resign when Morgan Carroll put a gun to her head to make sure she did not lose her sear as Senate President (ironic, huh?)"
Donald Trump is on the record for bragging about being a sexual predator.  U.S. Catholic Bishops have a long well-documented history of protecting sexual predators that otherwise conform with their positions.  No surprise that the bishops would overlook Trumps major character flaw.
Russia's Pravda published  a daily litany of lies and falsehoods the average Russian knew was just propaganda.  Glorious praise for the great workers paradise compared to the hell hole of American. capitalism.  The failure of the propaganda ushered in the collapse of the USSR  The failure of the credibility of American news  is no different. The elite system is collapsing because people know when they are being lied to and run to anything that has even a whiff of truth.
You are an IDIOT.

I am also disgusted by people who will turn a blind eye to the obvious corruption in the white house and with donors to the Clinton Crime Family Foundation. I have to wonder if they are just poorly informed or do they have a piece of the action. I can't claim they are stupid because the graft and corruption seems to be well planned and executed with cover provided by the New York Times and broadcast TV.
"""People don't burn other people alive""
You need to acquaint yourself with autos da fe in Middle Ages Europe. Christians did precisely that to women accused of witchcraft, Jews who refused to convert, Christians who were accused of heresy (that is, they held beliefs the authorities didn't approve of), and others. After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire.
If that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia.
Last year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it.
Terrorists are brutal. A lot of terrorists are Muslim. That does NOT make all Muslims dogs.

Or maybe the lack of engagement with ISIS and now it's explosive out of control growth which he was too afraid back then to address or maybe he had another agenda? Like being funded by his brothers in Qatar to let ISIS go batshit......

"Oh yes, Mr. Haxby, Trump is a hero for fighting against his ""foe"" and fake ne...wait a minute. That's some strong BS there Haxby.  Haven't you left out a few things?  

Wikileaks, Russia, Trump's campaign colluding with Russia and Assange, not to mention some in the FBI and more.  As for Hillary Clinton being a ""poor candidate "" and ""checkered past"":  Are you saying that Trump's past is squeaky clean?  As for being a poor candidate: I guess she just wasn't a good enough, non-stop liar like Trump.  Aside from working her ass off for the American people for decades, she was knowledgeable, competent and had been unjustly harassed by right wing nuts for her entire time in public service.  You, like so many Trump Chumps don't have the brains or integrity to appreciate her hard work on your behalf.

"I think you'll find very few that's ""making light"" of the organization. There are a few people from every group that are idiots and can't see value where there is value. Ignore them because they are insignificant and by giving a response or comment, it only feeds their stupidity encouraging them to make more comments. Focus on the positive, kind of like the organization is doing, and keep moving forward.  Looking back only gives people a sore neck and keeps you from avoiding obstacles in front of you.  I applaud them for their effort to promote youth to become better members of society. It helps all of us regardless of our race/ethnic background."
"John Havelock's selective liberalism is rather laughable and somewhat funny considering that he is listed as an ""university scholar"" at the bottom. He gave American football ""few more years"" but simple fact is, violence in sports, sells and Havelock's view of non violence in sport is only left of the Lord of the Rings. People boxed out their own choice. People played football out of choice. Everyone got a choice. There are many sports and activities that are literally life or death. Now Mr. Havelock want take that away due to chance of long term injuries?? Bit silly. If Mr. Havelock want to put safety bumpers all around, let him do so at his home. By the way, Mr. Havelock, driving a vehicle injured and killed more people each day then boxing and football combined for an entire year. Banning driving will save so much lives......but yet you are too hypocritical to advocate that, eh?"

"Sorry, I don't take seriously posts from whites who claim to be this or that--""Indian"", etc.--to try and ""validate"" themselves and their claims they're ""not racist"".  They routinely claim to belong to the very group they disparage.  While I actually have encountered ""Stockholm syndrome"" in one Samoan with whom I debated about the war in Iraq (he was a son of an innkeeper on Tutu'ila, and he'd been ruined by both the US military and the CCC of American Samoa), I generally regard such claims as attempts to hide from well-deserved censure by more reasonable people.  In the albeit unlikely event your claim is accurate, it's even worse--what Mexicans refer to as ""la mosqa en leche"" syndrome--i.e. identifying with those who walk on you in an attempt to salvage an illusion of self-respect."

(1) In the context of this discussion I understand you're referring to Samoans.  All the Samoans I know work on fishing and fish processing vessels.  They came here for fisheries employment--there are seven major Samoan families who've been fishermen ten times longer than the US has existed.  They go where the fish are.

(2) The ""wrong kind of people"" started coming to Alaska long before there was a PFD--first from Russia, then from Anglo-Amerikkka."

There is no time for staff to research a topic so I don't look like an ignorant idiot!

His words can't be 'adjusted' or taken out of context!

And he says bad things about important media people who have been around forever and are supposed to be genuflected towards!  

And he does it a three o'clock in the morning!

It is just silly to argue that Vancouver is somehow facing the problems of a high density city, given the news headlines in Vancouver, this year, in 2017:

""Vancouver has the highest proportion of empty, underused homes in 35 years""
""Number of empty homes in Vancouver hits record high""
""Data shows 98% increase in empty homes since 2001""
""New census counts 25,502 unoccupied homes in Vancouver, for 15 per cent jump over 2011""

And do you know what, editors?

This silliness in your newspaper today is what you get when you avoid the elephant in the room, which is the impact of the billions and billions of dollars of overseas money flooding in.

See, if instead you started your editorial decision-making with that key, central mechanism front and center, you would not be left with egg on your face for publishing silliness such as Vancouver facing a high-density problem (roll eyes).

Vancouver faces an overseas-billions-flooding-in problem. All else is secondary to it."
"Women don't like free speech because it hurts their feelings. Women are genetically programmed to be mothers, wives and home makers. Women traditionally have spent their lives in the family villages, in a communal village. No harsh words in the family circle because it upset the kids. You don't want to traumatize anyone. 
Men on the other hand are genetically programmed for heavier lifting. Imagine if all you had to do is call someone names and they would run away?  Humans would have died out long ago.

"[But Republicans, with their penchant for parading their patriotism, damned well ought to be leading the effort to uncover the full extent of Russian involvement in our last election and Vladimir Putin’s influence today. To do otherwise is not only hypocritical, but complicit.]
It is increasingly obvious that Republicans only claim to be patriotic as they continue to put party above country.  This morning's article about McConnell supporting appointing Garland as Director of the FBI is damning evidence as he wouldn't give Garland a hearing as an apolitical Supreme Court Justice which is even more important than as an apolitical Director of the FBI."
"""Silly me imagined that we'd made some progress now that we are in the 21st century""

Do you believe that anyone, including one of the most famous women in the world, can be convicted and jailed with sufficient prosecutorial zeal and a hostile court? Any conviction would be a travesty of justice. In spite of what forty million ignoramuses believe, Hillary Clinton has done nothing criminal. If Trump thought he had a chance to jail Hillary he would have jumped on it. He does what he says he will do, remember. The Wall - what idiocy!"

"Really, this morning the lady at the corner store repeated what happened just before I arrived. She and her hubby came here over 20 years ago from Iraq because life there was unbearable for Christians. A young woman came in the store to buy cigarettes, she did have a hijab on ,but looked underage to the store keeper. Abiding by the signed instructions she asked the young lady for ID,the young lady refused, saying she knew her rights. The store lady showed her a prominent sign about showing ID and the girl called her a piece of garbage.
The pendulum swings both ways. 
Now the girl did not threaten the lady so no harm , no foul
But it does go to show that there is infidelophobia"
"You want to know why wages stagnate? Because you have illegal immigrants that will do the work for a lot less. People like to blame Canadians for not wanting to take on ""scut"" jobs, but the ""scut"" jobs wouldn't exist if there was decent pay involved. Anyone want to work for the same money as an ""illegal""? Of course you don't, but don't try and blame Trump for a problem he didn't create unless he hires illegals which I doubt since that would be all over the news.

Trump is an idiot, but the illegals are still illegal. The worse that can happen is some white bread lawyer will have to cut his own grass or pay someone a lot more to do it for him.

People should read about Rome and its rise and fall and see the similarities between it and Canada and the US. We all want bread and circuses and free cheese, but no one wants to pay for it. Like Rome, one day, the immigrants will out number the Canadians and then we fall. Hopefully I'll be dead so good luck suckers, you brought it on yourselves."

"When the deck is stacked like these folks are doing it, it's just like Russia, no real news, no real justice system, legislators are puppets, cops are bullies and all our money is being redirected to the bully pulpit.
All we get to do is make jokes and wonder why we lost 58,000 of our peer group in nam fighting communism when this administration welcomes them into our country. I spent my 3 years training to fight the Russian blocks tanks now this outfit is buddy buddy because so called president trump owes them a lot of money? And sir how about the huge GOP push to restrict voting, gerrymandering and the electoral college, one man or women one vote is long dead in America.
Thank goodness these folks are so dumb, trump says the last President wiretapped the towers, somebody had to get a court to OK a wiretap so they must have been doing something wrong to get wiretapped. Maybe that's a smoke screen but now the question is ""what were you doing wrong to get wiretapped"" please explain...I"
"Why are you buying into the argument that there is a conspiracy to ban guns? Did I say that? Did Obama say that? Did anybody but the NRA say that? Of course not. The issue is ""what can we do to reduce gun deaths in our country"". No one is trying to take your guns away. In the last eight years how many guns has Obama seized?  Zero. Not a single one. I am stunned and saddened that this fear mongering which has proven to be a lie - is still effective today... 
To blame gun violence on a lack of morals or a breakdown of society in America without evidence is absurd. Look at any country in Europe. Compared to them, we are a deeply religious, conservative country. Yet they have a fraction of then the gun violence we have. 
We can keep our guns and reduce gun deaths. To think Americans are stupid, immorale and not capable of problem solving is shocking. I believe in the greatness of this country and its people. And  I'm convinced reason will conquer fear as we move into the future."
Feminism is cancer.
"Why is that supposed to matter?

Do you think this is a ""Well Jeremy Christian supported Trump but look at you liberals, you got Kathy Griffin that's pretty bad too"". The two are entirely unrelated. One is a has-been comedian who did something stupid - she likely deserves to be fired. The other is someone is a violent murderer who lashed out at people standing up to his bigotry.

The statements from Trump I quoted exactly. If people can't understand why they are bigoted racist statements then it just goes to show how isolated and out of touch many of his supporters are. I haven't heard one Trump supporter take a strong stand against his most inflammatory statements - that must mean people agree with it. That's the most frightening thing to me. It's not normal, and it's not okay. 

And please don't anyone respond to this with something like ""Well a liberal said..."". I don't care. Neither side should do it. We need to solve problems by coming together and disavowing racism and bigotry."
"You are wrong.  If this project were done without corruption, we would have a stable port right now.  It has nothing to do wit your ideological beliefs.  It has everything to do with skimping on materials and processes, paying people off, and dirty political tricks that Republicans shield themselves from by blocking anti-corruption legislation in Alaska and continuing to allow only the Alaska Bar association to discipline it's own members.  It's corruption, It's disgusting, and it will be the downfall of America itself."
"I agree that wahabi preaching mosques should be closed. I have been to Saudi Arabia and have seen how poisonous that ideology is. 

I think you would agree that neo-Nazi organizations should be shut down. That ideology caused over 60 million deaths in Europe. We should not accept those people under the guise of diversity either. 

Communist/Socialist parties across the world should also be shut down. They have caused over 50 million deaths in USSR, China, Cambodia, etc."
"It is like saying a drunk can not consent to turning the key of her car and driving drunk.

That's pathetic. Being a Turnip supporter requires abandoning all self-respect.
"Obama acted to do right by these kids because Congress failed to act. Obama showed leadership as the only adult in the room, and also a sense of compassion and justice. Trump doesn't care what effect his pronouncements have on people's lives or the country as a whole. Not a leader. Just a hateful, spiteful person."
Typical liberal PM. A total hypocrite but the holier than thou left-wing voters in Canada eat this baloney up like it was caviar.
Now there you go again bigot/racist.  Get out of Alaska if you live here.  Move to Texas or Idaho where bigots and racists tend to live.
I did not comment on the bizarre event of him driving along during the day with a body in his car.  I just can't fathom how stupid people can be...even criminals.  I'm glad he had not dumped her body yet or else he wouldn't have been caught.  I just wonder what they are going to do with the money!  Maybe the powers that be could divvy it out to substance abuse treatment or some group that works with prostitutes.  They could give it to some child feeding program.

How many times has Trump gone bankrupt?     How many suppliers has he stiffed in his years as a ""businessman"" while he sheltered himself behind bankruptcy laws?

Trump has never run a public company where he is answerable to shareholders.    He's never held public office.   In other words, he's grown up and lived in a world where he's never had to explain anything and where his Dad's money and influence helped hide all of his failures and faults.    It's becoming more obvious that what Trump is, is bat-s**t crazy, and not in a good way."

"[The ""Donald"" handing out a favor to Sheriff Joe, his old pal and fellow birther from years back is ridiculous.]

Plays golf when it feels appropriate.  And brooks no dissent or criticism without seeking retribution even if it means sullying his plaything.
He doesn't understand the honor or the privilege of serving because he cannot grasp the duties and obligations that comes with the office of the President of the United States."

"You're correct that much of the  press information is heavily ""America"" biased.  There isn't a lot of info presenting the ""other side"" of the situation, because that largely goes against the grain of the flag waving here.  After talking to several people who have close ties to Iran, I discovered that their government is accepted largely to protect them from us.  Considering what we've done over there, I can easily see why they feel that way.  Most Americans think it's some religious ideology as the basis for their dislike of America, when in reality it's a response to our behavior there.

But, the info does exist, especially nowadays.  And, stepping back and going through history while piecing that together with our behavior and the situation, the truth will be apparent.  Trouble is, to truly understand the truth, one has to drop their guard and be willing to be wrong.  Many here refuse to do that...hence the partisan garbage when both sides do basically the same thing."

"Of course, it's important to note when speaking about Clinton that she won the popular vote by around 3 million, the temporary POTUS and his family were involved in election violations, and are extremely chummy with the country responsible for hacking the 2016 U.S. elections. The degree to which the Democrats are ""out of touch"" with the American people cannot be compared to the criminal Republican party (colluding with a criminal regime). If it weren't for the former president's actions, millions would be without healthcare--and this the Republican party will do anything to take away. Many Americans are rightfully wary of populism--the American  variety is so frequently tainted with racism. The Republican party and their fake president are a stain on this country. But they'll never get what they deserve because (white) Americans are comfortable. If they don't stand up against racism--the violent immigration policies--of Trump and his base, I hope they lose their healthcare."
"I would give this article a little more respect if it said 'all people' rather than 'white people'. It would seem that the author believes that only white people are capable of racism and prejudice. 
Black Lives Matter is prejudiced. They hijacked the Toronto Pride parade 2 years in a row! They care about no one but black people, but white people are encouraged to support them? They are just causing mayhem like the white supremacists or the jihadist terrorists. Sure they don't have the disgusting history, but they have to start somewhere. All these groups are steeped in hate. They all suck."

They hit pay dirt. Trump is scum. The problem for Clinton was everyone knew she was bad as well. Both political parties are rather lame and mostly care about enriching themselves at taxpayers expense. The Trump Administration spends millions illegally taking military jets for joy rides.

The level of intentional stupidity that flows from our city management team is astoundingly depressing. How do you come to a conclusion of making a TAXPAYER funded program like our parks into a lucrative revenue stream on those very taxpayers? I mean seriously you guys.... really.....?

"Your hatred for the priestly caste and your virulent homophobia prevent you from acknowledging the obvious. Sexism, misogyny and homophobia are pervasive in space and time and represent a primitive dichotomy: man or bitch. It's why gay men have suffered more opprobrium than lesbians: gay men are perceived to assume the role of the 2nd-degree human female. Like practically every institution under the sun, Christian theology inherited and perpetuated this dynamic. We know the Catholic Church is hidebound by its shrink-wrapped theology and pretensions to infallibility. It's hardly an excuse to vilify an entire group of people based on sexual orientation."

"Obama has not been a great president.  But he has not gotten us involved in foreign wars while at the same time lowering taxes, like Bush Jr.  He has not embarassed the nation with a ridiculous plan like the Iran/Contra scheme, ala Ronnie Reagan.  The economy has actually improved under his watch, though not as much as we want. All things considered, Obama has been the best president this nation has had since LBJ.  And unlike LBJ, he hasn't gotten us emersed in a messy foreign adventure.  So I'd rate him as a very good president, similar to LBJ and Eisenhower.  That's reason enough to vote for Hillary as his successor and the person to continue his legacy of achievements.  This is especially true when the alternative is an absolutely absurd baffoon named 'the donald.'"

Trump will gather a small army of ""flappers"" (Gulliver's Travels) around himself, and bumble around the world on ego safaris.  Meanwhile, we will carry on, all the while telling him what a great president he is.
Hillary, on the other hand, is ""used goods"".  Sorry for the offensive term, but she will do as always, get revenge.  She hates!  That is one of the most uncontrollable passions, and why we should deeply fear her becoming our president.

Couldn't that over ten million be better used in the classroom ?     With the Aces done , UAA stands to benefit in increased attendance.  However , Alaska sports fans hate losers .  In hockey and baseball your doing good if you win  60 to 70 percent of your games. Aces win a number of games , but not enough to increase attendance . With the Aces gone , a number of fans may start attending UAA games.  Rest assured they won't tolerate UAA's consistent losing and will stop going as loses build. Fire Thomas now."

The discrimination against males in colleges is based on Title 9 interpretation by the Democrats in the position of power that are controlling 100% of Higher Education. The ratio of males to females in colleges is dropping from 4 to 6 to 3 to 7. It will lead to the demographic disaster as Men tent to marry down and women to merry up. A college educated female will not marry a plumber or HVAC technician. Virtually all college educated females will remain spinsters or will be forced to whore around for companionship.

"No. The REAL issue is how you can't understand that the hair issue is JUST AS important as the guns. In both cases - it's an issue of fundamental human rights.

When the rules of the school enforce a western look on all kids, that is fundamentally undiginified, racist and harmful to the pupils of other races. Pupils whose hair are not naturally straight. Whose cultural expression  of 'neat and tidy' bear no resemblance to ours.
In one sense you are correct - hair is inconsequential to the education process - but this only makes the children MORE right about this, BECAUSE It's inconsequential to the education process - there is no legitimate reason for schools to have hair rules at all. They exist PURELY as social rules - which cannot apply cross-culturally without causing real and lasting harm to somebody. 

30 years ago, my own atypical hair led to daily beatings in school (it was still legal then). I thought they were evil and stupid then. I was right. Yet the stupid lives on."
Ok noted...More of your ignorant racist comments.
"The recovery had almost nothing to do with Reagan and almost everything to do with Fed chairman Paul Volcker's easing of short-term interest rates, which had been set high to end the stagflation that plagued the Clinton presidency. The deficit spending for tax relief has never been shown then or now to have had any measureable stimulative effect. It was a giveaway to rich people. Once again, we have a consumer economy. Corporations don't expand business unless they have an expanding market, and putting money in the hands of consumers works, because they will spend it all. The rich buy stock and portfolios and keep that money. Reagan was a pretty but dumb actor. As we have seen, a lot of Americans love pretty but dumb actors.

I don't see any revisionism in Krugman. He apologized for that overreaction. Those who follow Krugman understand the circumstances and are OK with him. Those who have always hated Krugman and other brainy economists continue to loathe him, so nothing changes."

"I've never understood the Republican platform on this. People (including Democrats AND Republicans) aren't going to stop having sex. It just isn't going to happen, regardless of the weird Puritanical fantasies some pro-lifers have. So why not help prevent abortions through contraception? It's not the entire answer but it's a part of the answer. But Republicans, supposedly pro-life (which is laughable) want to eliminate one method that helps prevent abortions. I want to get back to a point where I meet a Republican and not immediately assume said person is an idiot."
"I would welcome all the illegals if they don't need support of any way, shape or form from taxpayers. That means they just live here, and we treat them as if they were self-reliant strangers that don't help from us.  That is how liberal I am. 

But since these illegals do need help from us in terms of housing, food, education, medical care and so on and so forth, it is very expensive to just let any tom, dick and harry to come into this country and deprive needy Canadians of the support that they deserve from the government. I say seal the border and shut out the illegals. That is how conservative I am. 

You bleeding-heart liberals and religious fanatics, go ahead and sponsor your illegals. But don't expect me and the other taxpayers contribute one dime to your liberal cause. And please open your own houses to these illegals, and feed them and house them. And do not complain if they rob your blind."

How does it demonstrate ""...the left's desire to silence any and all who disagree with them""?  That ascribed motivation is very theoretical methinks, but handy if you are trying to come up with a way to deal with the reality that academics tend to have big, smart, critically-thinking problem-solving brains and as a result they often do not tolerate the emotional stupidity that is rampant in the Trump age.

If conservatives can't handle being bombarded by reason & logic, that's sad, but let's not blame it on some drive of academics to make stupid people feel stupid.  Stupid people should naturally feel stupid when called out, but we live in a new age where people believe every thought is equally valid.  It's been a disaster for dialog in America."
CHIN- shut up and sit down!
"I would agree with you if those arguments you cite were reasoned.  Too often the charlatans that make up the right wing media machine will do a multi-show ""expose"" on some liberal conspiracy, only at the very end say that they found nothing.  Unfortunately the rubes that truly believe this idiocy don't hear the short bit that claims the previous week's shows were all just speculation.  I listened to it with Beck and the FEMA camps, and it happened again and again through the entire Obama administration.  

As for the idiots on college campuses, that is a whole other bag of poo, the kids there can't seem to understand free speech.  Bear in mind, though that just because you have a right to say something doesn't mean that you will find an audience that doesn't think you a fool.  The best thing that could be done to folks like Coulter, is when they speak at a college, no protests, but instead, let speak, their foolishness will be enough."

"Ok...it took the Las Vegas PD about 90 minutes to find the shooter. They have no leads or no possible motive. The shooter's girlfriend appeared to be in an abusive relationship with him where it's been reported he readily berated her in public.

The shooter made over $5 million last year from gambling. How is all this possible? Has he come back from the future that he is beating the odds time and time again? 

Maybe it's that the FBI and Las Vegas PD are a bunch of idiots and believe what they're being told? There was some sort of ""note"" in the ugly hotel room where the shooter killed himself. All this sounds like nothing but a bunch of incompetent people involved. The worst part is the authorities will never know his motive...but I am sure his girlfriend has some sort of idea even if she has blocked it out of her mind or is too clueless to realize why the shooter did what he did...or she's in on it too."

The early Republican party was left-wing--the anti-slavery party of Lincoln. Pro-slavery was establishment and therefore, right-wing. Anti-slavery was anti-establishment and therefore, if a political tendency must be chosen it would be more left-wing. The U.S. Nazi party was right-wing. George Lincoln Rockwell's ANP was founded in 1960 on the ideas Adolf Hitler espoused. FDR disdained Nazism while Henry Ford who rain for the GOP nomination in 1924 and was a Nazi-sympathizer like Charles Lindbergh.

"Yes, Layla, the communist government of China exerts influence and often effective control over not just Chinese publications and electronic media abroad but also over other Chinese controlled businesses and even social organizations, all with the objective of taking advantage - in trade, investment, immigration and political and social power - of the schmucks who are naive or greedy enough to let them do so.    

Currently, the biggest concerns and buyers' remorse abut these one sided situations are voiced in Australia, the US and Germany but it seems not a single country involved in trade deals with China is on record as claiming they are happy with the fairness of said deals.

One of my most disturbing visuals these days is that of PM Trudeau sitting across from the Chinese leadership in about 4 years to complete negotiations on a free trade deal between China and Canada.

Really?  Then why is the NRA not standing up for the black man that legally possessed a concealed weapon and was shot and killed when he was trying to retrieve his ID seems to me if it was a white guy that was shot the NRA would be standing out screaming but since it was a black guy you haven't heard a word out of the NRA about the persons right to a Concealed weapon and not be shot and killed by the police remember the black man was a legal gun owner   With a legal concealed permit  he was following instructions reaching for his ID which was in his back pocket when he was shot repeatedly by some loser cop......
"Pay attention people!

When politicians, ""entertainers"", and TV talking heads, use the words "" F**k You Trump!
When ""comedians"", stand with mock severed heads of our President,
When ""actors"", and directors, believe it is OK to show a mock assassination of our President as Caesar  in a Shakespeare play,.......
There will be wacko fans of the Radical Madcow who feel that it is not only alright to kill the President or those of his party, but feel it is their duty to do so.
This is what the Left has created with their vitriol.
And they have the nerve to attack Rush Limbaugh as a Hate mongerer.

The HATE has been coming from the Left every single day since Trump was elected.
These killings are blood on their hands!"
"I'll even go so far as to say she should be forced to issue a public apology, in her own words, to Trump. She should have an inconvenient discussion with the Secret Service, and probably face fines and even jail time for such a threat. And if she's let go by her employer for this stunt, I won't shed any tears for her. 

It's one thing to say Trump is a horrible person and eviscerating him on late-night TV for his horrible actions. That's protected free speech. Calling him a human cheeto is fair game, especially given what Team Red did to Obama over his 8 years. But when you cross the line into threatening someone with death (suck my machine gun, severed head), you should expect a painful reminder that all rights have limits..."
"Because castration doesn't remove his ability to rape more women.  Castration is the removal of the testicles, not the penis."
"The mindless loyalty of Trump's base supporters and of his little band of fans here, in the face of his obvious incompetence, has more to do with their childish stubbornness and inability to admit their mistake. In their pathetic desperation for the blustery leadership of the so-called strongman who'll rescue them from their disappointing lives, they have given this bogus president a blank cheque, forgiving of his every word and act. No leader, left or right, deserves such uncritical loyalty. They seem to have him confused with Jesus."
"""Retrograde"" would be the kindest word one could apply to Trump and his fans. The Dems have their problems alright, but Donny has taken his troubled nation backward and empowered the worst of the right -- the supremacists and NeoNazis, all the usual rednecks, the sort who dismiss science and formal education. And some still insist on seeing him as a revolutionary, even with his silver-spoon existence and Goldman-Sachs advisors. 
Those who deny the reality of his record low polls would be the first to crow if those same polls rose in his favour. Hypocrisy is an essential part of the Trump regime, as is the trick of denouncing as ""fake"" any report that contradicts his blustery nonsense."
"I wonder if 2 years of sexual harassment proven and verified asking for help from Michael Strahan ever did anything!

In your first sentence you start making your case with your opinion, but I beg to differ (I want to be fair so I will fight opinion with opinion), what he said was not even close to being as viscous, condescending and judgemental as  what the Podesta emails revealed. Then you go on to state Clinton is wrong on abortion but....... There is no but, her stance and that of the DNC are wrong and it really is that simple. You are the worst case scenario of what you accuse others of being, and you use gov't and supreme court decisions as a crutch to justify moral decisions instead of using your free will, your brain and your faith.

"I hope everyone will read about the people who were massacred in Quebec City by a right wing extremist. Two owned grocery businesses. Three were civil servants for the Quebec government. One was a professor at Laval University. They were all Muslims, and all immigrants. They are the people that haters tell you won't integrate into Canadian society; that tell you how Muslims don't belong here because they're different. Yet what I see is people who came to Canada, went to work, and integrated successfully into Canadian society. What a loss for our country! They above all knew how blessed it is to live in a land of tolerance, prosperity and freedom. Then it was all snuffed out. Does anyone doubt that a home-grown cloud of intolerance and hatred directed at Muslims, in our country and others, played a role in this tragedy? Yet as Muslim immigrants, these people did everything right by Canada. It was our country and its people that failed them."

It's a bore to watch.  The champion team should be determined by playing the ACTUAL game, not a shootout---may as well flip a coin or draw straws.   A tie in the Stanley Cup is determined by sudden death overtime until a goal is scored--however long takes.    I'd say it's a drawback of soccer but the whole game seems is a snore.  The most entertaining part of soccer is watching the drama queen players take dives."

"There's a world of difference between sexual content, even vulgar sexual content, and sexual assault. I may or may not enjoy a movie with graphic sexual content, but I find nothing harmless in sexual assault, which is what Donald Trump has been accused of and admitted. Consent matters. I believe the main characters in the fictional Fifty Shades of Grey engaged in consensual activities, which makes the book and movie irrelevant to any discussion of Mr. Trump's habit of sexually assaulting women.

"I am glad to read positive news and efforts of active members in our community working toward a common good against an evident evil. Salmon is one of our most important resources in the state and among one of our main exports; the declining population poses a threat to thousands of already established jobs (more jobs than Pebble will produce), along with communities that rely on them for their subsistance. Supporting a project such as Pebble is a very stupid move: copper prices are declining, when the minerals are extracted from the soil it will be barren... whereas salmon is a sustainable resource, if taken care properly it will keep on returning for our nourishment. There is no way around it: this proposal is good for the community, good for the environment, its action like this that is what we need to thrive as a society."

As I've said, while I don't agree with the veil I have to agree with the woman's choice to wear one. I can see how you feel this is a way to subjugate woman and reinforce the ""property"" aspect of a male/female relationship but isn't it better to allow the woman the opportunity to remove the veil in her own time rather than forcing her not to wear one? Isn't that just a different form of forcing an external viewpoint on her?

As for ""numbers"" whatever you meant was somewhat unclear. The wearing of a veil is still rare in Canada and terms like ""mass immigration"" are meaningless. What quantity is ""mass""? What reduction in the current immigration levels would mena that it is no longer ""mass"". And frankly even with our current immigration levels, the number of women wearing a veil is very, very low.

"Obviously the logic of this piece is somewhat wanting. But I actually agree with the conclusion -- the military charges against Bergdahl should be dismissed. Instead, he should be charged with treason in a civilian court, and when convicted he should be sentenced to death."

How can loving parents, even Catholic parents, support their gay child (who may be going through some very difficult times) if they don't know what it happening with their own kid?  

You assumption of Catholic parents as incapable of supporting a gay child is absurd."

"That's probably the  biggest criticism against democratic centralism, if the core is rotten like in the ANC, the whole organization becomes rotten, and the only hope those that are aware & object have of changing the organization, is to reject the central policy binding on members by going against the flow. 

Such a stupid concept really; willingly subjecting yourself to the whims of some public servant god-king, capitalism FTW!"

Probably the second one.

"Another illustration of the Trump administrations's modus operandi, best described by MacBeth

Signifying nothing."""
"Please provide some examples of Democrats who have statements as radical as Trump's.  His rhetoric:'worst ever, most terrible, losers, someone told me'- shows ignorance and not a little fear of the real world he doesn't understand."
"Yet another liberal loser who can't even put his dislike for Trump aside long enough to recognize a real patriot, and his grieving wife, for doing his duty.  These writers are probably just pissed off because the illegal immigrants brought to the speech by Democrats got absolutely no attention.
These writers cannot face reality and will never stop their condemnation of Trump and his efforts."

"The core is summed up near the end, where she writes she wants to bring Justin Trudeau's quota system, for insisting on plentiful women Cabinet Ministers, into science:

""We led by example with the first ever gender-balanced Cabinet (and with) the first feminist international-assistance policy [which sees the VAST majority of Canada's foreign aid aimed at women and girls!!!]. Science would benefit from adopting a similar approach...""

Hello?

Does the writer think Canadians are blind, lacking in memory?

Look, when Justin Trudeau came to his senses months later, he TERMINATED women cabinet ministers from their posts for lackluster performances and REPLACED them. VERY EMBARRASSING and VERY MALADAPTIVE MESSAGE for gender relations in Canada. 

And the writer wants to bring THAT MESS to universities? With SEXIST grant funding akin to Liberal foreign aid ?

I thought Trudeau's team was all about ""evidence based"" government. Hello? We have seen the evidence. Quotas are sexist and awful."
"A good book that explains the Trump fiasco is ""Empire of Illusion: The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle,"" by Chris Hedges. The Trump followers simply cannot separate truth from illusion--a peril of being stupid."
"Granted the Repubs are likely going to simply grease the slippery slope the country is on, but a President who only made matters worse in the middle east, escalated the booming debt, and enacted a health care bill that's a pile of junk is hardly a great president.  He pandered to his voters and the big money, and not the best interests of the entire nation.  The only real difference is he was sharp to sweet talk the public instead of being the loud mouthed idiot who's in office now."
"Trump's voters all understood not to take him literally but figuratively. Silly progressives and Progressive Conservatives, the right in Canada and the USA is so much smarter than you. Trump's supporter's votes and support was all just a meta commentary on Hilary Clinton and Bill Clinton's penis!"
"Your comment is racist.  Let me explain why.  You seek to marginalize FN by emphasizing that we are Sovereign Nations in a way to ridicule.This approach ignores the realities of treaty agreements and self-assumed responsibilities of Canadian governments at all levels under the Indian Act.  The facts available through the INAC website show the Fn's in question are grossly under-funded to meet both treaty and fiduciary obligations.

If you read the article, you will see the facilities provided were unsuited for environmental conditions.  This is typical as noted in 10 years or more of Auditors' General reports.

Readers posting comments need to be mindful of the responsibility of knowing the facts on an issue.  The spout unsupported personal beliefs tp denigrate is simply racism"

"NK can kill nearly all Americans right now with:

1) EMP attacks 

2) Biological weapons -- e.g. smallpox -- released in cities

3) Nukes smuggled in containers and/or launched from subs, freighters, satellites

4) Cyber attacks that destroy the grid.

Especially if 1),2),3), 4) are coordinated.

China & Russia pay lip service to sanctions, but they do not enforce them.  They provide NK with technology, money laundering, and work for NK slave labor.

China is trying to steal most of the South China Sea to control key sea lanes and natural resources. NK diverts attention from
this theft.

Iran, Syria & Pakistan are also NK allies.

Kim is a murderous psychopath who has reason to hate the US & Japan which he daily threatens to annihilate.

Hence the US & Allies must devise a viable scheme to kill Kim.  It is not a perfect solution, but  it is the best solution.

Otherwise Kim will continue to develop better WMDs & delivery systems.

And he will use them against U.S. Allies and the U.S."
"Hate to rain on your parade people.  I just sold my house, paid 202,000 some 25 years ago and just sold it for 860,000 and damned if I'm prepared to allow this deal to be screwed up by the Wynn govt and her whiners.  Toronto and area is a world class city and should have world class property prices.  We have been under priced property wise for years, time to catch up with the rest of the world.  I will be moving my close date up to counteract Wynn's move and then facilitate a relocation to a province where Liberals are an endangered species."
"Lets gentrify Spenard and destroy everything that makes it popular. They already ripped down PJ's, and are building low income housing there. Who do they think is going to move in there it should be storefronts. Now it's going to be drug houses. The owner of Pj's was selling coke and breaking the law but PJ's served as a resource for old, ugly, pregnant, one boob'd cancer survivors to earn another boob, or  to make a living. It was a landmark, and a source of $6 pitchers of beer cheapest in Spenard, and questionable entertainment. Guess they will go back to hooking on Spenard. Don't forget drinking, hookers, bars, and cocaine are a huge part of Spenards history past&present."
Wow a president that is actually backing up what he campaigned on. How refreshing. I don't understand why the press continues to call those that come here illegally immigrants. I call them illegal aliens or invaders.

"Idiots. The damage is already done. Housing in TO is already far out of reach for everyone except the one percenters. Any new legislation brought forth now to address the problem is too little, too late. The only thing that would bring RE prices back down to earth would be a major housing correction in the neighbourhood of a 30 - 40% (or more) drop in values. I don't ever see that happening. Bottom line - even dual-income average wages today are nowhere near sufficient to service the average mortgage. Prices are absolutely ridiculous with no reason or justification."
Ridiculous.

"I suggested you research it but clearly I wasted my breath.  I even provided a link that explains how it was brought up numerous times before Reid ever got to the Senate in '87.  How is it possible for Reid to ""resurrect it"" if it was used regularly before he came along?  If you weren't such a partisan hack you would have avoided looking like a willful idiot.  All it would have taken is maybe a minute to read through the facts you were just provided but that would require you to exercise even the smallest mote of skepticism in your own self-righteousness."
Well based on Mellerstig's behavior I feel threatened by him. Based on his logic I can shoot him.

"Gladys is right on.  These four Lane County Commissioners are rotten to the core.  Yes, there is political bribery in both parties, but in this instance, these guys are about as rotten/corrupt as it gets.

One side's ""nasty crap"" does not excuse it from the other side.
You guys love blasting Hillary Clinton for being venal, mean, corrupt, and a liar in her political and governmental dealings, while totally ignoring and whitewashing Donald Trump's reputation for being venal, mean, corrupt, and a liar in his business dealings and in his political campaigning."
"The very same people that applauded Comey's handling of Clinton are now the very same people attacking Comey for doing exactly what he did with Clinton. The only difference is it is now about Trump.

This just shows that certain members of the USA care more about their team winning than finding the actual truth. They need their side to win so badly that they are willing to swallow whatever poison pill they need to just to stick it to the libs.

Trump and his ilk supported and loved Comey until Comey started to investigate Russia. Now they act like he is a serial liar and a terrible person. Just like Trump his followers have a consistency problem. They can't keep their stories straight because they have to adjust them every few hours to stick it to the libs in a new way.

They are okay with serial liars, as long as the liar's name is Trump.

It is the purest form of Party Before Country I have ever heard."

I've even switched insurance carriers when they wouldn't agree my video evidence was enough.  Fortunately, the courts agreed with me.
An interesting outcome, is that I think I am driving more carefully WITH the dash-cam.  So it's a win-win for everyone.  Except the ones who get caught being stupid......"

"Hillary Clinton told the media that Americans elected a man like Weinstein.  Yes his name is Bill Clinton and Americans are still trying to get over that.

Here's the biggest part of the whole sordid Weinstein affair.   People like Hillary Clinton and her cronies have condoned and coddled this type of behavior and they are are just as guilty as the man himself.  As long as these guys are big donors to people like her then turning a blind eye is easy.  I still have not heard Biden say anything to the media. He and Harvey are buddies.  

Then again lets face it there never has been as big a sexual predator as Bill Clinton and the media still loves him."

 I do find it a bit amusing that you manage to criticize Ms Clinton because she did well in the debate. She was well informed, articulate, poised and very statespersonlike.  Yet, you twist that to be detrimental.  Had she, like Trump, been unprepared, nervous, rude, and ill-at-ease for the entire debate, you would have criticized that.  She did very well, so, instead, you are saying, in essence, ""Clinton did badly because she did so well. She had no business being so well prepared.  She had no business being so poised.""  

You have really made it clear ""she's damned if she does (do well) and damned if she doesn't.

BTW: I rather tire of being dismissed as just ""another Democratic Party sheep""; following the Party line.  Such comments trivialize my views and are, to me, insulting.

"Richard Rhyner's attacks against Unions throughout the comments below are hypocritical, ignorant and factually wrong. Mr Rhyner is a retired (and disgruntled) city worker whose own Union membership has earned him a decent retirement. Good for him. But his incessant attacks against unions seem like self-loathing at this point. 
But his factual errors are worse than his hypocrisy. He asserts that the Mayor was elected by Union voters in a backdrop of low voter turnout. This is factually untrue. 

The Mayor has a mandate from the largest voter turnout EVER in a municipal election and this was a RUN-OFF election, historically low turnout elections, making the Mayor's accomplishment even more impressive. 

Mr Rhyner can waste his retirement being a curmudgeon if he wishes, I would like him to be a better citizen by not spewing nonsense."

Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied.""

"When the permanent fund was established, the statute prohibited the legislature from appropriating any of the principle of the fund but ""permits use of the fund’s earnings for general governmental purposes.""

"Sadly, you have hypotheticals in your narrative as well, James. 13 years ago I was with my sons in an Indian restaurant in downtown San Francisco. As I headed to the men's room there was a commotion in the ladies' room. A transgender guy dressed as a female prostitute in a very short skirt was in the ladies room shaving his legs at the sink to prepare for the evening. He had no underwear on so his junk was clearly visible as he had one foot up on the sink. This was all apparently no big deal to him, but a female patron had complained to the owner, who was confronting the guy and holding the ladies' room door open as I walked by. I figured, wow, so that's what goes on in San Francisco. Now this will be coming to a ladies' room near you and your young daughters, minus the confrontation. The brazen attitudes will increase exponentially as the administration enables their behavior. It is only being done to increase the turnout for Hillary, not just for the benefit of the trangendered."

"Trump wasn't exactly wrong with his initial statements.  The tiki torch wielding alt-right idiots, their counter protesters and various militias showed up armed and ready for conflict.

However, any HS class-president could have crafted a better statement.  Trump simply spews whatever is currently rattling around in his melon, no matter how delicate or nuanced the situation.  He issued catastrophically dumb statements on North Korea, Venezuela and Charlottesville just in the last week, all of which worsened the situation.

"Trump's first bluff with China was his blunder over the One China policy, and he folded like a house of cards, causing the Chinese to laughingly proclaim him a paper tiger. The armada bluff was similarly disastrous. You have to be as naive as Trump to think that the Chinese don't know where US aircraft carriers are at all times — and that they don't share that information with North Korea. Calling the armada story a bluff is giving Trump too much credit; more likely it was a spontaneous lie that left the White House staff scrambling to provide cover for him. When the inevitable happened — Trump's lie was exposed — Trump just looked like a fool, again."

"How odd. I watched that debate and the stage set up was with Trump on the left, with a chair there, and Clinton on the right with a chair on her side. The picture and comments were about her speaking to the seated audience on Trump's side of the stage. She walked across to the left to be facing them, appropriately, and was therefore on Trump's side of the stage (just calling it that because of the setup). When the camera was switched to that side of the stage so as to show Clinton face-on it appeared that Trump was behind Clinton facing her back. I don't think he even moved from his chair location. She moved over to be in front of him to address that side of the audience. There was no sneaking up behind her by Trump. Why don't they show the whole stage from the ""front"" where the moderator was? It puts this stupid comment to rest as a lie.

That, my friend, is the politics of hate, and it's game you're playing most deceitfully.
It's a game that will lead to a very destructive outcome, to the point that already we are seeing the benefits of the community that the Ukrainians and others worked so hard to build now being eroded.
Adult children who have NO IDEA how fortunate and spoiled they are, are so busy having tantrums about imagined unfairnesses they are completely unprepared for the real dangers of an increasingly unstable world.

-Second Law: The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.
-Third (and Golden) Law: A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.
-Fourth Law: Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at -all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.
-Fifth Law: A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.
-Corollary to the 5th Law: A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.

Far be it from her to attack people who believe in honour killings. But you can see why she would be sympatico with Justin ""Get the f--k out of my way"" Trudeau.

"Dear Localstateofmind, no one is ""just a jerk"". humans are products of our life experience including the values we are taught to uphold growing up in our society.

The point of my comment is to compare and contrast the values of traditional Hawaiian society in comparison to the values of western/American society. Hawaiians are taught to malama (nurture and sustain) the natural world because to do so insures the survival of our society. westerners and Americans are taught to rape, plunder, pillage, pollute and lay waste to nature in order to exploit natures resources for the wealth they can produce for the wealthy capitalist elite,

as to my ""thinking to deeply"", that is a part of my job as a Minister of the Hawaiian Kingdom and a Policy and Strategy Advisor to the Kingdom. Those who govern have a duty and responsibility to ""think deeply"" about all matters that effect the people and the nation.

I know right its not like the people there know more than you. They probably are saying they told the people to leave them alone sarcastically whereas we know you are both credible and straight... I mean you are commenting online not like those shmucks who show up and stand around in the cold like l0sers!
He is unreasonable and ridiculous.  This should frustrate the right as well (and if it doesn't then there is something fishy going on).
"Mr. Sherman... Quoted from Patrick J. Buchanan, We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude?
What more opportunity is it that the White people need to give to help the Blacks?
If the poor white got this much opportunity there would be no poor white or lower class of white trash people!!
The main problem why black people are not progressing is the, ""They owe me factor""!! Get it in your head! No Body Owes You Any Thing!

Talk about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Go to Altoona? And Johnstown, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids?
Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America?"
"Hancock knows the Black Community will vote 99% for a black candidate, no matter how little that politician does for them. He can screw them over all he wants to try and get the Hispanic vote. Throw in the 20% of white voters who love to pat themselves on the back for supporting illegals and he is untouchable."
"Meanwhile in other insignificant news, also rated as drivel, rain fell in the Amazon.."
"I wonder if all the pedophiles are sent to the sex offender prisons in all cases.  I've heard these guys love these special prisons as the same subject of conversation 24/7 reigns. so now we are going to host this manipulative, useless creep for at least 25 years in prison.  if he lives long enough, he gets out in his 70's  and starts hunting all over again with a pent up libido and all kinds of advice as to how to ""succeed"" this time, as per his inmate peers are concerned."
"This is totally false.  It is YOU who is distorting and trying to defuse the impact of the horrible comments trump made about gun owners shooting Hillary Clinton.

It wasn't a joke when he suggested violence against Clinton, and it is more pathetic that people like you try to pretend that's not what he did.  Everyone knows that's what he did, hoping some deranged gun owner would read between HIS lines and shoot Hillary Clinton.  That is what happened, whether you deny it or not.  You just can't handle the fact that your candidate is a nutjob."
Why is it called 'Stunt Driving'?  Such a stupid term for what is speeding or racing.
Emily Jashinsky is a moron
I'm surprised some rabid Third Wavers have not labelled Bev a gender-traitor and reported her to the CJC.
"I made that claim to you at the time and you denied it at the time. You just claim the priest is innocent. Maybe it is your strong support for clericalism that comes across. Look at Disqus yourself. 
Donald Trump used fear and anger of minorities to win the election. Racial intolerance to blacks. Religious intolerance to Muslims. Nationalist intolerance to Mexicans. This has resulted in some incidents reported on the news where these minorities have been verbally or physically attacked. These lives matter as well. Trump is responsible for his divisive hate campaign. How will this make America great again? How will he be president for all the people by without surrounding himself with a diverse group of people.
The Catholic Bishops support for Trump is designed to collect funds from their rich republicans. The minorities are ignored. Quoting Burke generally show support for his point of view.
The country is deeply divided and it is time to stop the fear and anger. Not support it."
"Stop using the word ""rebel""! 

These Islamic terrorists are just looking to create the ""Islamic Republic of Syria"" (with the added bonus of Sharia Law and its caveman mentality)"
Maybe you should move to San Fran and go live in a box with the other human trash.  Alaska has lots of hard working people (including natives) which don't want to support these lazy people.

"Hey, pseudo--""anomie"" doesn't mean what you think it does.  The primary meaning is breakdown of customary social and ethical norms.  It also sometimes refers to personal alienation from society that results from such breakdown.  It doesn't mean ""the absence of any emotion at all""; the word for that is ""alexithymia.""  And it doesn't mean ""depression"". Both of these are clinical entities.  ""Anomie"" is strictly a sociological concept.

Not one penny of federal money is used for abortions.  Federal money that goes to Planned Parenthood is reserved for women's health needs such as gynecological screening and contraception, of which PP is one of the major providers to poor women.  Of course the government doesn't want states to accept money designated for those needs and then simply deny it to PP because a religious clique controls their legislatures and wants to make a grandstand play for their fans.

Reread Schopenhauer, idiot.  And stay away from Pound--he's too hard for you."
"Yes - You go Jaded ! Let's eliminate all the babies who might grow up in difficult circumstances, that's the answer, but wait, how about these old people who are just as miserable, let's eliminate them as well. We can't do it overtly, but we can cut off their insurance and coerce them to do it themselves. Yes, that;s the answer - Go Pete Go..."
"It's about the economy, stupid!

How long will it take to understand that."
"What absolute nonsense!  Coming from this mutt and his leanings as a Dimmocrat, it's 'par for the course'.  First, Colorado drivers licenses, now, 'a fund for legal aid for 'illegal aliens' to fight deportation'  Here Illegally, broke the laws of our nation, and this 'mayor' sets up a 'fund' for their legal plight, what absolute nonsense.  Has anyone ever debated this 'mayor'?  He's a real dope, and the embarrassment would be entertaining."
"Finally, you're showing your true colors, Ryan.  Absolutely disgusting."
Obama was the fool
There's already more than enough there to run Dolt 45 out of office and then arrest him.  If the Republicans weren't so craven and settled on taking away health care from millions of Americans in order to give a tax cut to the wealthy he would be gone already.
"I'm sure Mr. Mellerstig has similar sentiments about his child. Thank goodness the child was not injured, mutilated, or killed. Dogs are not equal to children. If you think so, I have no frame of reference to deal with you. You are out of your mind."
"God. Democrats are sick, sick people! Why would this pass along party lines? It should have been UNANIMOUS!"
Please stop with the 'this republican' crap. the deficit is the result of many decades of hot check writing by the state government and both parties share equally in the blame.

"It's good to read a balanced report of this issue. Compared to many international media outlets the G&M refrains from this hysterical yellow journalism that is the rage at many newspapers since trump won the election.

The guy might be full of hyperbole, an egomaniac and a buffoon, but he's not stupid; nor is he the right wing monster those media make him out to be. Impeach Trump and we get Pence - the end of social security and the final nail in the New Deal."
"Anyone else notice how his staff and supporters look like corpses?  Initially i thought they looked reptilian, but the smell of death seems to follow in their wake."

"Well, there actually is a fix for ""stupid"". Unfortunately the only fix available for ""stupid"" isn't legal -- yet. :-)

But I really need to talk to Darwin about that theory of his, apparently the gene-pool-cleaners have been shirking in their duties in ridding the human-gene-pool of all its disasters. I say we remove all guard-rails and warning-labels from everything for a few generations. That should bring things back in balance somewhat."
"You and others here are doing your best to convict Donald Trump of sexual assault via hearsay. When the shoe was on Bill Clinton's foot, the left did all they could to protect him and his hideous wife. So yes, you are well schooled in hypocrisy.

Openly boasting about groping women is a far cry from exploiting the power of the presidency to seduce interns, cover up rape and sexual assault. Allowing men with a psychological disorder to act out their fantasies by entering women's restrooms and insisting it's some sort of social justice issue is simply bizarre.

It appears to me that you have plenty of time to do your own research. Maybe you should broaden your search from Thinkprogess and Huffpo.

Sorry you missed the last one but at least you agree then that Hillary belongs in prison."
"What a joke and waste of time and humanity!  The ""liberation"" of Mosul was declared 5 months ago!...so why are the Iraqi forces still encountering resistance from Isil? Hey USA, you idiots started this mess so, go back and finish what you started so Iraq can get on with it's future!.....so incredibly typical of US foreign policy!"
This is the woman who after killing her baby was found having sex in a car. A long list of arrests for drugs and more. She was in no way able to take care of a kid. When she found out she was pregnant she should have gotten a free abortion.
"If you read the transcripts of Trump's conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia, you have to ask yourself which is worse: the leak or the indisputable fact that the leaked conversations prove, without a doubt, that Trump is a moron who is utterly unqualified and unfit to be president?"
"Some are dumb enough to hate you for being you, most are not. You should question your perception before assuming anything of others."
I'm sure he feels threatened by your juvenile comments (were he even to see them). How childish.
South Korea's president blasted Trump's irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric.  Kim will not give up his weapons of their development.  Trump failed again to do anything other than strut and play the fool again. Even Republicans are distancing themselves from this TV entertainer.
"Tony, so good to finally hear from my silent stalker. 
First off, Bill Clinton was terrible. 
Bill Clinton may have been a disgusting man lacking morals, but he actually was draft eligible, unlike your draft dodging coward Trump.

Bill Clinton received deferrments, just like Trump. But in the Fall of 1969, Bill Clinton entered the draft and was eligible. His number was never called.

Get it? No?

Why are trying to say it is okay for Trump to be a draft dodging coward by pointing at the very disgusting Bill Clinton?
That is li,e saying since Hillary is a murderer (she is) then it would be omay for Tru p to be a draft dodging cowardly rapist.

Is that what you are doing?
Okay, now why do you support a draft dodging coward like Trump?

Maybe it would be better if you go back to being a silent stalker?
Unless you want to explain why you support a draft dodging coward like Trump."
"No wonder Americans have no respect for public education leadership. What a complete asinine policy that wastes the time and efforts of all involved. Contact the police? To alienate, humiliate, and publicly shame children is in the ""best interests of the children""??? The superintendent Christy Perry and the rest of the ""leadership"" team reflect their innate levels of sexual sadism."
"Now report on the other side of this story, do some research and report some facts. Totally biased garbage!"
"Well stated. God damn the poor. How dare they ""invade""  my comfy world with their bloody poverty and needs."
You think that's all we have left?  You can't fix stupid.
"Many years ago, I was naive and thought that everyone had the intelligence to be successful but the effort was variable.  Then I started tutoring kids and realized that some people are just dumb, and even with hard work, are limited in their potential unless they find something that they can excel at and pays wells.  If the parents are dumb, the kids are likely to be dumb.  Being dumb means a lot of things, such as divorce, neglect, time not being spent with kids on school, lack of effort, limited success in school, etc."
"You're deluded thinking illegals here pay their fair share of taxes.  They don't pay a penny more than  they get get caught with.  They cheat, they lie, and they steal from citizens and the country as a whole.  They're ILLEGAL.  They don't want to get in line. They don't want to pay their due. They don't want to pay taxes.  And they don't want to obey the laws of our country. And if they can get away with it, they will.  There is no morality in their lives;  just escaping from their horrific home country and stealing Americas hard earned wealth and power.  And where it's given, yes, we have plenty to share.  But, OUR poor, OUR unemployed, OUR citizens deserve it, not them. And yes we will be paying MILLIONS to Zika infected  illegal  anchor babies and their mothers. And millions of OUR poor will have to do without, or at least significantly less. I think people like YOU should be deported to Mexico until you quit undermining your duly elected POTUS, like some commie infiltrator."
"This argument that the use of chemical weapons crosses some red line and demand a response - like ineffective  bombing of assets, leaving airstrip intact - is beyond ridiculous.  The inane, depraved, unconscionable, assumption is that it is better to kill babies with barrel bombs?  Is this REALLY an argument we are making or want to make?  At the root of it all is the KILLING OF INNOCENTS.  SMDH."
"On the contrary, they are made to escape with a heavy package that will ensure they won't have to work again in their lifetime. How would you feel if someone who stole your car gets a reward of another one from the police? It's ridiculous - their power and influence."
"Liar, liar pants on fire.  A requirement to run for Governor, Mayor or Senator?"
"The protestors that I saw on the news  this evening looked liked folks that didn't have anything better to do and just were there for something to do.

That being said - let's face the Liberals did little to educate Canadians on what the 3 options, and their various derivatives, would mean to voters.

The survey that was done was abysmally ridiculous as well."
"Yawn. One dimwit replacing another.

Outing of incompetent Nayef indicates that campaign against Daesh/ISIL is not going well. It also means it will go worse under untested Salman.

With Iran-Saudi and US-Russia rivalry rife, and Saudi fate in young hands, the ME future is a foregone conclusion. Out with US, Saudi, in with Russia, Iran, and Turkey. The West is on the wrong side of history.

Saudi Arabia represents 1400 years history of ""the religion of peace"" - father following son in Kaliphate or Monarchy in futile pursuit of gore, glory, conquest, and colonialism, just to live off other people's money (OPM) by imposing Tariffs (Arabic word of Kaliphate origin) by controlling world trade and closing the Silk Road. Maggie Thatcher famously said the trouble with OPM is that it soon runs out."
Just racist.  All societal problems are the result of him being black.
"Because Murky and all the rest are cowards and Lars like you, Mabry. None of you can ever accept responsibility for anything;  just a bunch of whiny little bit*#^s."

"I am so ready for the lid to blow off on this. I wonder if there is a special prison for convicted politicians? There will be so many, a new wing may need to be added.

Finally the MSM can be proven to be the biased liars they are. And the liberal trolls, how I cannot wait until they are silenced.

I have stood my ground since Trumps campaign and have never wavered. I have been 100% correct so far. So believe me when I say, you ain't seen nothing yet!!!

Strap in and hold on, it's gonna get wild!!"

"Yes, some say that it is silly and ridiculous for Catholics to determine, despite being nothing more than laity, however devout, that they have the authority to decide who is and who is not a member of the church.  Perhaps those who do these things should try reading the catechism more, or consult with the God Ordained Clergy, who alone have the power to eject people from the Church, and hence condemn them, rightly, to eternal torment in the pits of Hell.  I do hope this comment is well received and provides some guidance and insight where it is so evidently needed."
"Rick, why are you eating all the animal's food? Those poor animals are starving because of you selfish vegans."
"Nice rant, completely off topic, which is completely expected from a die-hard leftie.

2. Concur. 
3. Concur, REASONABLE regs, not stupid, senseless, overbearing ones that are more concerned about a small fish than farmers and other Americans
4. Concur. 
5. See #3

I've got a rant, as well. 

1. Americans deserve to have their Constitutional rights respected and protected. Yes that includes - gasp! - the First and Second Amendments
2. Americans deserve to be left the hell alone from their government, as the Founders imagined, and NOT have every aspect of their lives ruled by leftists who think they are the smartest ones in the room. 
3. Americans deserve to keep what they have earned, rather than have it confiscated and given to worthless lumps who sit on their fat asses watching Ellen all day long.
4. Americans deserve an HONEST media that is more interested in reporting the truth than advancing a leftist ideology."

"The profits go to executives and shareholders.  90% of companies these days are basically just hamsters on a wheel, that was purchased by some billionaire, Oligarch, or multi-national conglomerate.  The end products have been homongenized to near worthlessness.  The processes have been engineered to the point they really don't need skilled people.  All that is left for employees to do is to suck up, cut throats, and backstab."
Let this child die.   There are far too many babies that need this money who doctors know will survive.   This couple needs to let their child go and move on.   Take this money they have and give it to other children who need the help.
"I can scarcely recall what I imagined the internet would bring when it bloomed a generation ago. But my speculation about an interconnected future did not include reading the real-time rage-tweets of a malevolent clown while he pinches off a loaf in the White House throne room, having been placed there by traitors, racists, misogynists and assorted goddamned nitwits.
Nope. I did not see that coming."
"Oh yes, Kevin is such a silly man, every one knows the Trudeau Liberals created the Not-Winstanding-Clause to abuse Canadian's Human Rights, not protect them. Silly, silly man."
"Most Canadians are

Now we read of his handing out a 5.5% increase and $650 bonus to the federal public service unionists to buy their votes, at a time when federal spending is already out-of-control.. Just like Ontario's Kathleen Wynne Liberals, he's a cancer on Canada."
More proof that Liberalism might be a mental disorder.

Why should the West continue to participate in this ongoing aid futility ??!!"
"""hog"" is right. The beast has to feast, just to survive."
"Putin, to his credit, seems to understand that retaliation will get him nowhere. 

He can deny all he wants but unless he can convince America that Russia did not interfere in the recent election his denials and retaliations are to no avail. The American public is just waking up to the notion that the Russians interfered with the election. Things can only get worse if Putin throws gasoline on the fire.

Americans may be stupid but they are not that stupid as to be duped for long. Eventually they figure things out.

Russia was stupid to think it would not be found out or that there were no consequences if it was."
If it is not Dem propaganda they will they want to choke it down. Dems need to just shut up and go for the ride. They are worthless and would destroy America rather than it suceed under a non-Democrat.
Trash
"Too funny! Liberals and their costumes.  I can't decide which is more ridiculous - this, or the pink kitty hats.
On November 8, the anniversary of Trump's victory, a bunch of them are planning to scream up into the sky.  This should be very entertaining."
Calling someone stupid does not reflect well on you or your decency and ability to participate in an adult debate on issues. In fact...using the words you feel okay to apply to others...well they make you seem rather st*pid.
"Look like Leah is heading for a divorce.

No surprise, she is white and the statistics say most white women initiate divorce.

As a middle aged business owner that makes in about 100-150K a year annually, taking no vacations, working 70 hours a week, ALREADY paying 53% tax in Ontario, this proposal ensures that I have no incentive to try to grow my business for more 47 cent dollars.   

If this goes through, I will work less, probably live longer, but I will be sure to donate to the Conservative Party of Canada as much a I can afford as the only pathetic measure I can use to protest against your assault on how I've spent the last 20 years of my life, on my retirement, and on my children's future. 

I will never forgive what you are doing it.  Meanwhile how does the Liberal government spend this money?  Outside of Canada to a large extent, or on non-Canadians.   Sickening."
"It isn't involves an idiotic grin on his face as if some minor, childish rhetorical point is a major victory. The guy had a huge amount of maturing ahead of him, Tim will tell if that is within him. But he can stay with wiping the stupid bratty 12 year old boy grin off his face."
So kill it huh angel?  All heart aren't you?

"Your examples are accredited universities that have to meet high standards to maintain their accreditations. The online schools Betty DeVos would allow have no track record and nothing to make them accountable. We would have thousands of little Trump universities scamming students, their parents and the state departments of education out of millions of dollars. Dumb idea."
UnAmerican if you have a so-called orange wannabe presidential candidate advocating mob rule.
You can't fix stupid
"Crap propaganda !  Both sides hate and accept funds from haters. Seems as though the Liberals are way more violent than the Conservatives, but are painted as more violent by the False News Media? Remember your history ! African tribes were the largest group of Slave Owners, and they sold their brothers and sisters into slavery."
"Yes... Hillary and company are winning the Gender War that is raging in the US election... and Trump is getting bashed from all sides.  He has two Gender War cards left in his arsenal of smut:

1. Hillary is a lesbian and will not be accepted as Commander-in-Chief

2. Hillary has cuckolded Bill and is a fraud..!

... and both cards are being tossed around in Trump's circle of supporters... quite sad but politics is a dirty nasty game... wonder how that will go over ....lol"
"Trumps whole agenda is just to undo anything Obama. He cares little about proper policy, whats good for his country or any individual group. What he cares about is undoing anything Obama because Obama has made him look really stupid, but then again that wasn't all that difficult when you are dealing with a narcissistic idiot in the first place.

The Trump presidency will laughed at for generations and he has nobody but himself to blame. Remember, he picked the finest team ... nobody picks one better. Just look at his picks now eh Mr. Sessions and others"

"Progressives also believe that the 17 agencies talking point was done for impact sounds a lot better than 3/4 ! More impact makes it seem more real ! And please note the three agencies being reported they all didn't say ""highly confident.

The odd thing about this whole thing is in showing any confidence in a report given to them by a private security firm hired by dnc to investigate the server . The report they handed in was full of holes and our intel took it w/o question and w/o being able to check out the server themselves,  ! I call bull💩!"
"Sadly I believe the majority of the bill for these privileged stay at home idiots to be marching is footed by demasculinized husbands, boyfriends & fathers on their day off work & probably cooked their own breakfast, took care of the kids, chopped the wood & were forced to masturbate if they were lucky enough to borrow their balls from the safe."

The ranting of a pure Aryan White Supremacist glorying of the pseudo-election of his new Fuhrer, Trump, to free the Neo-Nazi Aryans to begin the violence just like Nazi Germany.  This nation needs to stamp out this evil just like it did in 1940s.  The big mistake was not doing it to the embedded racist bigots infesting this nation since its formation."

Justin- we all understand how you have a desire not to be perceived, but unfortunately, our perception and not your desire about our perception is what matters.

And moreover,

 ""Obviously, we follow all the rules and I am assured that the folks who are managing my personal finances are following all the rules.""

"Are you saying we need an actual war to tear down all the monuments to racism and tyranny that you Unite the Right guys love so much?

The fact that the white supremacists are willing to have another Civil War rather than give up their monuments to white supremacy, anti-black racism, and tyranny says it all. Wouldn't be a complete day on the internet if a nutty racist wasn't salivating for a new civil war. Pathetic.

See you at the broadcast of the next Unite the Right rally. I'll look for the unhinged guy with the nazi armband over his Colorado t-shirt, waving a mosquito repelling tiki torch, sweating, spitting, grinding his teeth, shouting ""bring on the next Civil War, man! Bring it on! White power now and forever, man! You'll have to pry my racist tyrannical statues out of my cold dead hands, man!"""

"Flynn was an idiot to put his boss in a compromised position, much less having conversations with the Russians as described. That said, Trump gathered all the evidence and fired Flynn.

Step 2- get arrested for violation of foreign feminist policy. 
Step3-  Have case thrown out in court.
Step 4- Protest abortion in front of abortion clinic

"Buy the dumb voters with massive debts for their children. (Worked great for Greece.) Saddle taxpayers with $1 billion in penalties shutting down gas plant contracts to buy two election seats. Pay wind and solar electrical producers to not produce, more than doubling off peak consumer hydro costs since 2006. Then artificially reduce consumer hydro bills by substituting even more debt to hide the cost of the green power fiasco and build radio commercials around this ponzi scheme pretending the government has done voters some kind of favor. That these buffoons could be re-elected speaks to the lameness of the Ontario PCs as well as the low mental bar set by Ontario voters."

It is interesting that while desperately seeking some means to understand why so many young Muslims are willing to carry out acts of extreme violence upon their fellow citizens writers like the author ignore why so many other disadvantaged sub groups are unwilling to do so..."
"Paul Krugman ""Could ignorance, incompetence be the silver lining?"" Actually as it turns out Krugman and other liberals ignorance and incompetence is the silver lining that helped to elect Trump.

The better question is what ""lessons reasonably rational citizens "" learn from a liberal, Krugman type of meltdown?

From one of the latest mainline news conferences Rep. [D] Maxine Waters claims President Trump is currently supplying bombs & bombing Aleppo, Syria. Waters also claims Trumps, Putin/Russia is currently invading Korea. While Maxine Waters wants the-Impeachment of Trump, Rep. [D] Nancy Pelosi believes Bush is still the current President and that she can't work with Bush. At the news conferences both Pelosi and Waters claim Trump is ‘Incoherent,’ ‘Incompetent,’ ‘Reckless’.  Really? Hilarious in light of Kruggy questioning if ""ignorance, incompetence be the silver lining?"". 

I'd say yes as liberals continue to provide more evidence Liberalism is a mental illness."
"From their website, ""The Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) is an independent, public corporation of the State of Alaska."" Which I believe is a fancy way of saying it is a public entity that is supposed to represent or serve the citizens of the State of Alaska. Please correct me with facts and sources if I am incorrect. 

Given this, if I am correct, their refusal to provide a copy of the agreement they signed in our name because it is not a ""public document"" is bloody obscene. Yet more evidence that Alaska has become little more than a corrupt banana republic run by dishonest oil companies through their chosen lackeys (who we are dumb enough to keep electing on the ""God, guns, and gynecology"" ticket instead of actual meaningful issues - which would of course require we pay attention).  

Honestly, if a deal is good enough to sign in our name (which is who the State is supposed to represent), it should be good enough to hold up to public scrutiny. If it can't, don't sign."

We remember who shot up and killed Hungarians when they rebelled against puppet communism in 1956.  Some of us have looked down the Fulda Gap or across the Berlin wall in Germany and seen Russian tanks from 50's to 90's. Some can even remember who joined up with the Nazis to destroy Poland in '39.  Trump's followers better get a grip on who Trump's BFF really is, he already invaded Crimea and has a new base in Syria.  These are the same ole KGB thugs who've poisoned and shot anyone who disagrees with them, anywhere.  Trump, a natural born con man and is learning from a master KGB thug the art of deflection.

The shooting of black people by the police are incomparable to shootings of white people pm e by police. Forget black on black or white people, this is about oppression.

"""The acknowledging of white privilege is a simple, intellectual acknowledgement of the cultural and structural barriers that people of colour sometimes face. It's child's play to understand the point. My adopted black son gets approached by police more often than white kids. ""

Hello Toulouse.

There is an American book called ""Fundamentals of Criminal Justice: A Sociological View"", and on Page 69 of that book it is pointed out that 90.1 Percent of black murder victims were killed by black offenders (even though black folks make up only about 13 percent of the US population).

Got that, Toulouse? In the dangerous streets out there that you mention, a black person is about ten times more likely to be killed by a black killer than by a white killer. 

Would you like to run by us one more time how ""white privilege"" makes the mean streets a dangerous place for black folks?"

"Dysphoria is ""a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life."" You are ignorant. Most people experience dysphoria at one time or another. The military accepts a lot of people who have one mental problem or another, such as a desire to kill people. The desire to kill people you don't know is inculcated into military men in their earliest training. I went through it, but it didn't work on me, I enlisted for a noncombatant MOS that I got based on my test scores. I didn't want to get into any firefights, that seemed pathetically stupid and evil to me. And I know I'm not the only one. The military is intrinsically mentally ill."
"Trump won because Clinton's VP was too white and because of last minute stupidity by the FBI chief. The polls reflected it. Trump also spoke the Bishops’ line on abortion enough for them to edge four states he should not have won. Sadly, Hillary should have taken the Obama line that the Pro-life movement is an electoral scheme, giving many Catholics cover. She was winning the pro-choice vote anyway. If she had done what I told her in 2007 we would not have an idiot in the White House."

Nice try andy but your fear mongering and hyperbole are absurd. No one is trying to ""steer innocent and confused children and adolescents towards irreversible gender re-assignment surgery"".

Your characterization of science's ""deafening silence"" is ridiculous. In fact it's the research on sex and gender that has helped us better understand LGBT people and tear down prejudice against them. The cure you need is for bigotry and prejudice.

The real objective truth and natural law is that homosexuality exists, human sexuality is a spectrum, and that teens will have sex just as they have been doing for millennia. Denying that and vilifying people who don't fit your narrow world view is simply no longer acceptable.

The irony of you suggesting that I be open to those concepts while displaying your own closed attitude is rich indeed."

The only people who ever truly stood in the way of Leftist Fasio-Communism were in effect those who represent people with common sense. They are neither LEFT OR RIGHT. The Left have nothing to offer. They use the old MGB, GRU, NKVD, OGPU, KGB tactics of social division to conquer. In fact most idiots posting on here dont ever realize that most slave holders were DEMOCRATS. Most politicians advocating slave ownership and the quelling of real minority rights ( being women and blacks) were DEMOCRATS. George Wallace was a DEMOCRAT you morons.

Last year's 5-way race (damn judges petition rulings) was a perfect example.  The highly diluted field allowed someone without broad appeal (Glenn) to take the nomination with just 37% of the vote.  The result in November was predictable.

They really need to switch to instant runoff voting where there's more than 2 candidates in the race.  Until they have that, then the party needs to practice the age-old method of weeding down the field internally before the primary.  That had already happened last year until a damn judge decided to ignore the ballot petition rules."

"I was just noticing all those knock-off blacks for Trump signs.
 
Those signs are printed out to make it look like they are hand-painted but the give-away is the amateurish error in judgement that printing so many that all look exactly alike makes it apparent they are not hand painted, they are knock-offs.

The other problem with all those knock offs are the white hands holding them up.

If Trump discovers how clumsy his set decorators are, he'd likely fire them.

"Then, unite with me, Les.  Advocate correction of THE most horrible mistake our country's electorate has ever made.  This is beyond embarassment or loss of national dignity.  It is dangerous.

I agree with you.  United we stand, divided we fall.  And, unless we unite to compel Congress to act and remove Trump from office, we will fall.  Because he is the most divisive and dangerous force this country has empowered since the Confederacy.

Trumpist rhetoric is losing any virtue in logic or reality.  It would be silly, if it weren't so dangerous to continue to enable the guy.  But while silly implies stupidity or ignorance on some level, it is also euphemistic of wrong.  Trump is dangerous.  To us all.  That's the only way to describe him.

McDonalds policy was to keep coffee at temp X but many stores, including store in question kept coffee at X+40 (or something like that). WAY too hot for human consumption, intake, etc. The reason the lawsuit stuck was because of this issue and the fact that this happened way more than once. I think I remember reading the cotton in her sweatpants actually melted into her skin it was so hot. 

Additionally, the woman (actually her kids because I believe she was an older lady) tried for years to just get them to cover medical costs and McD's refused. It wasn't until much later that someone with a little more clout picked up her case and made a big deal about it. In the end she still didn't ask for, or get much, if I recall correctly.

The results?  Zero, zip, zilch, nada.  Gritz had no credibility with his POW/MIA nonsense, so he turned to politics where he failed at several attempts for political office including Vice President of the United States.  He also failed when he shot himself in the head with a .45 caliber pistol in a suicide attempt in 1998.  What a loser.  When and where did you serve on his team?  What was Operation Freedom."

"It is funny how the ignorant of today believe they understand the mentality that existed up to the Civil War. As always, CONSERVATIVES rewrite history(or minimize what they do not agree with) to be of their liking and consistent with their present day agenda.

After the convention approved the Great Compromise, Madison wrote: ""It seems now to be pretty well understood that the real difference of interests lies not between the large and small but between the northern and southern states. The institution of slavery and its consequences form the line of discrimination.""

To imply nearly 100-years later(Civil War) what had been a monumental issue(slavery) in the creation of the USA was 
now reduced to the North telling the South what do as the motivating factor for fighting by the southern soldiers is absurd."

"Wonderful commentary Mr. Begich, thank you for adding your voice of rational and reasoned thought to this debate.

The time to confront fascism has long come and gone even as the evil has grown inside the nations heartland. We defeated it before and we will defeat it again. The Nazis in Charlottesville were given a permit for their rally on Saturday but they went off the rails on Friday night with the tiki torch parade so their permit was revoked. Meanwhile the anti fascist/racist/nazi demonstrators were given a permit by city government for a rally in a different part of town on Saturday.

"As reported by CNN, the New York Police Department’s Counterterrorism chief has evidence that the many threatening phone calls to Jewish community centers originate from a single individual located overseas.

One extra-territorial person using spoofing technology does not a rise in U.S. anti-Jewish sentiment make. OTOH, NYPD’s evidence is not inconsistent with the thesis that this rash of threat calls is foreign, state-sponsored terrorism. Stahl, Sr., asks “Which state?” and suggests Israel has the means, motive, and opportunity.

The community center threats have been reported since late January, after Trump’s inauguration. I can’t think of a more existential threat to Israel than an isolationist, nationalist, America-First President who wants to cut foreign aid. Sprinkle in some spicy speculation that Trump is a Russian tool, and Israel may think it faces the perfect political shit storm. Drastic times would require drastic, but hardly unprecedented for the Mossad, measures."

And, if you read the Bible, the Torah, the Qu'ran, they all have one overriding principle in common.  They all say that God NEVER gave the right to man to judge each other.  In fact, that is a right God held back only for Himself.  And God NEVER says anywhere in any of the religious texts that there is anything wrong with homosexuality.

"Particularly, if supporters show up openly armed with civilian style assault weapons, which is almost certain to happen in some States with open carry laws. Some of the States, nearly all Republican with open voter challenge laws are going to get out of control. What do you do when someone carrying an AR15 or AK47 challenges your right to vote because you ""look like a democrat or a potential illegal alien?"" Some of these people are just nuts, sorry but truly deplorable. Certainly a minority, but mobilized and feeling enabled by Trump."
"These days there is now such thing as white supremacy unless you promote racism.  If anything, there is more black supremacy than there is white."
"Andi you're being used by believing the out of context crap in that video. Come on girl you're better than that. Tried to do a copy and paste of  an excerpt from Politifact's analyses of that video. They try to put nuance and context into what are carefully edited, slanderous half truths and innuendo but it won't work so please do yourself a favor and google up ""Politifact on video of Clinton's lies"". Your passion for Sanders is clouding your judgement and eagerness to believe the worst about our future POTUS. She is not the monster, liar or corrupt person that the right has beat on for the past 30 years. Hopefully when Bernie Sanders finally endorses her at the convention you will give up being influenced by these blatant lies about her as well."
"Spoken like a true elitist. You're so arrogant that you made three faulty assumptions in the same breath, that 1) only the poorly educated would vote for Trump 2) people born into wealth can't be good leaders, and 3) TV stars aren't capable. People like you are the reason why the Democrats failed so badly."
"I will have to check the latest when they publish, but given the brackets earlier posted and changes in deductions, I fall in the group mentioned and my taxes would have gone up.  This bitch be playing for the Republican team since she is talking about those brackets and rules as this mornings changes have not been specified."
"Frontier is a sham. Their published ""discounted"" fares are only for a middle seat, and includes no carry-on or checked bags. You literally have to pay for a non-middle seat, and pay to bring any luggage. Southwest has it figured out, and will continue to get my business. 
Too bad, I used to love Frontier back in the early 2000s and gave them plenty of support. They have chosen profits first over customers. If they did it the other way around they most likely would still be profitable."

There is very little evidence of voter fraud, and the few cases that have been found did not have effect the outcome of an election.

Scumbag Hillary? What does that make Trump? Scumbag groper? Scumbag sexual predator? Scumbag tax evader?
"Mike McQueen - Exactly. Add to it that this road will be built through a highly active avalanche zone and we'll spend millions of dollars a year trying to keep it open. And, that is not picked up by the feds in any way.

Then also to remember that this doesn't actually go Haines or Skagway, but to another ferry terminal that still is needed to actually reach the road system.

I understand that Juneauites feel trapped by their virtual island experience, but this road will essentially be a placebo, something for them take to Sunday drives on. That's a silly reason to build a road anyway, but in these challenging fiscal times, it's downright ridiculous."

"As disgusting and immoral as President's Trump attack this morning was, I can't help but NOT feel bad for people in the press like Mika and Joe.  They aggressively courted him.  They gave him hours and hours of free airtime, all he had to do was call in!  The crazier he got during the election, the more these media fools courted and promoted him.  They made this FrankenTrump monster."

"When you have NO evidence that in these days, whites in general do NOT believe that black lives don;t matter, and there is ample evidence that in general whites believe that black lives DO matter, it is a vicious racist lie.  More than 150 years ago, scores of thousands of white boys died to end slavery.  Jim Crow followed in some places, yes, but it was whites who ruled those laws unconstitutional.  Then there was busing, and ""race norming"" (giving an applicant for a federal job more points on a test merely for being black), and affirmative action in college entrance and private sector jobs.  And you still say that whites in general believe black lives don't matter.  Where is the everyday killing of blacks by whites?  Where is the everyday wanton maiming of blacks by whites?  Your statements reveal the utter moral bankruptcy.  I will continue to treat blacks as equals, as human beings, with respect and courtesy, despite your best efforts to make me hate.  You failed miserably."

If you are going to compare BP's Alaska's operation in 2015 to 2014 and not adjust both years for the sale to Hilcorp of significant assets including personnel, oil production, and vendor contracts, you are simply comparing apples to oranges; garbage in garbage out. Man, do a better job!!"
"A vote for Hillary is a vote for more national debt and massive immigration of cultures that do not accept us.  Obama has increased our debt more than all presidents combined.  European countries have completely destroyed themselves by allowing massive immigration of muslims. Muslims make christian conservatives look like peace loving liberals. Germany is projected to be a muslim majority by 2060 due to child births, at that point you will see Sharia Law put into place and women will lose all the rights they have fought for. Sweden and Norway are practically destroyed. Sweden is the rape capital of the world."

I appreciate that MANY people see this guy as a potential change agent, but that aside, you cannot possibly dispute the fact that he is a vile human being. He is a liar; he is a thief; he is unethical in his business dealings; he is disrespectful to anyone that chooses to disagree, fight for their own positions, or fight for what is rightfully theirs (like payment for work completed on one of his garish, overpriced properties); and he is dismissive of any woman that does not provide some sort of services to him (and this includes efficiently and effectively managing his construction projects, not just sex)...

Many of you that support this man are locked in the battle known as cognitive dissonance: How do you think well of his potential while acknowledging his nature? Deal with it as you may...the rest of the world sees this guy as the pond scum he is..."

"I'm still not sure why the Governor was not handling public relations.

"No-I care.  

Those uncaring make this political human beings  might want to look in the mirror and ask themselves why they do not care about the victims, the injured and only politics. 

Because instead of words of comfort and sorrow, they verbally attack using the word ""Trump"", which is no sign of caring about the victims, the people, themselves.

Who are these idiots who keep trashing these inane ideas that Trump had forgotten to do something...he was talking to people when Pence reminded him what still had to be done (and that is what Pences job is for God's sake!).  These idiot Newsies haven't got enough to do but to keep printing their garbage and stoking the fires!  How they are loathed in, and around, the U S A!!!"
rallying people to kill cats makes you one. but then i think you enjoy just baiting people with your drivel. maybe you need to go home.
"Like I said you can't grasp it. We have to put up with intolerant people here because  they were born here. Is it that hard of a concept. We do not let in those who are intolerant and give them Canadian rights. Your kids will have zero tolerance until your kids grow up and start living in the real world, start paying exhorbitant taxes, exhorbitant prices for homes, food, water, bills, etc. Doesn't mean they'll be racist. Just means they'll learn about debts and how we cannot afford to help every poor soul. It is a numbers game and if you haven't noticed our number is at a trillion and Liberals have been projected at an added 1.5 trillion of debt.  Wake your dumb a$$ up. I studied the charter in school way back when and knew it was for CANADIANS not immigrants."

"3 issues. 

 Pedestrians don't act like a car can hurt them.  Doesn't matter if you are ""right""  this isn't victim blaming it's reality.

It is way to easy to get and maintain a licence.  People don't actually know how to drive and they don't know WHY they are doing something / why it's important.  

Police focus on the wrong behaviour.    Speeding isn't the most dangerous thing on our roads.  Unpredictability is, not telegraphing your movements and not signalling is far worse then speed.  We are letting drivers of the hook and they aren't communicating or acting as is they are on the road with others and they NEED to communicate.  If they had this mindset / approach there would be a shift.  

Everything is always geared to the lowest common denominator.  Enough with that, raise the level of our drivers.  Pretty soon all the speed limits will be dropped to 20 K, because people will need to be protected from their own stupidity."
"Gary, what are you smoking? ""Justin Trudeau, on the other hand, has a much better understanding of the role the oil sands play in the national economy. He appreciates that they must continue to exist ."" He wants to eliminate the oil sads!!!!!!

"Yes - I felt many of the tea-baggers and their rallies were not productive, and were foolish, with people dressing up in colonial attire, tri-cornered hats and all, and wrapping themselves in the flag while hollering ""small government!"" and ""less taxes"" - all while waiting for their Social Security checks to clear ...
You have me confused with being a conservative - it's understandable - I have opinions on both sides of the aisle, and don't march lock-step left or right ... normally that gets people from both sides upset and they get on their ""If you not with me, you against me!"" horses ..."

"Trump doesn't need the media to inflate the absurdity of his comments. His comments are reckless and idiotic enough on their own. 

And as a veteran, I wouldn't give him so much as the time of day given his horrible comments about McCain, and what Trump laughably considers ""sacrifice."" He bent over backwards to ensure he never sacrificed anything to our nation's security or armed forces. He's a loudmouth over-privileged coward with a hyper inflated ego.

He's also been the most dishonest candidate so far in this election by independent sources who review the validity of candidate's statements."
"Over the years I've heard people make stupid and (sometimes) offensive jokes. Very occasionally there has been actual meanness behind the joke. More often it is thoughtlessness.

"RadirD, you're an idiot."
OMG. Your post must be satire. You must be trolling. Fascism and racism? That is liberal bread and butter. That's not going anywhere while they are in power and it's probably the last thing we need to be dealing with right now when there are actual real issues besides that division politics nonsense.
How exactly do you stop someone from modifying the triggers on their guns? Its illegal already. Silencers are restricted just because Hillary made a stupid statement about them after this event does not make them an issue to discuss in context to this tragedy.

"Well now, which nazis or KKK or Alt-rgt (What the hell is that?) is Trump trying to please now -----  Let's hope that this NAFTA farce is over and the US is further behind as a world power and continues to be further isolated from reality.  Not only is Trump not reasonable, he is not intelligent, nor discretionary, just gutter street smart.  (Remember that he is the child of a bully and who now himself has become a bully.)  But where are the Republican Senators who will eventually in about 5 years time vote on a new NAFTA agreement after they have impeached this idiot!  Not to be seen or interested, frightened of losing their seats but signing on to a misfit president.  Shame on them!"

"Ah, the old hypocritical ""you drive a car, right?"" or ""you use natural gas, right?"" argument, when almost all used automobiles and nearly all new vehicles still use gasoline, and to function in rural America, one needs his/her own automobile. Hypocritical would be if I criticize Oil and Gas for illegal dumping, but then I turn around and dump my used motor oil down the sewer.  

The problem is, Fort Collins residents are told by the city that they shouldn't even wash their automobiles in their driveways, because of the chemicals that can come off and flow into waterways.  If any citizen were to dump their oil down the sewer, the sensors would detect it and they would be ticketed.  Yet, Oil and Gas is once again laughing at the law, opting not to spend extra money to transport their waste to Adams County or Pueblo.  Oil and Gas, time and again, feels that the law only applies to others.  But then again, endocrine disrupters?  Nevermind those innocent little things."
"Larsy,
Trump is neither a conservative nor a libertarian.
He's a con man whose only allegiance is to himself."
"He knows who, where, how and when they got their drugs, they had been buying drugs every payday together. SHE DIED. And he isn't talking.

"It's interesting watching and listening to the protests going on in response to Donald Trumps' assumption of the presidency. These people are supposed to be protesting against Turmps intolerance, bullying, treatment of woman, promotion of fear of Muslims etc. What I'm seeing and hearing from these protesters and the organizers is no less hate filled, intolerant (see the exclusion of a feminist, pro life group of woman from the march), bullying (see the pressure put on celebrities by other celebrities to get into the group think against Trump), and outright ridiculous (see Madonna thought about 'blowing up the White House') than that which they are accusing Trump of.  I have one word for these folks - hypocrites. They aren't prepared to accommodate anyone who doesn't see the world the way they do. This doesn't bode well for social peace in the future."

"What is most disappointing and depressing, but not really surprising, about the US ban is its stunning partiality. Of the 19 attackers during 9-11, 15 came from Saudi Arabia, and one from Egypt. The female half of the couple that attacked in San Bernadino came from Pakistan. These are documented, identified assassins from Muslim majority countries that are NOT included in the ban. Bannon, Flynn, Conway and Trump are almost bracingly stupid and mendacious.. the problem will be where they find themselves out of depth with  much more formidable adversaries.."

Treasonous Trump.  His Presidency should be under tremendous scrutiny.  He has already shown his penchant for me me me over country.  Why should Americans accept that?  We wouldn't.

We're the people who have:....Ideas, who create business, who hire people, who, above all else, ""PAY TAXES"" to various levels of incompetent governments!   OK, let's refresh....CONSERVATIVES create, most of the ""REAL"" employment in this country and pay the, ""MAJORITY"" of taxes!...

The Assad government has not been killing its own citizens?   At best it's a draw between factions but I'd wager the body count for Assad/Russia in being to look like the chain saw versus Paul Bunyan and his Ox.    For god's sake please don't try to justify either."

He's like Harvard's Larry Summers. The latter suggested, to an audience of female scientists, that one hypothesis explaining the dearth of top-tier females in STEM fields is female choice. For daring to say that, the female scientists got hysterical, worked to get him fired, and added evidence that females are thin-skinned, emotional, unable to tolerate different viewpoints, and lack leadership grit."

"Putin didn't expect that 23% of eligible voters would be dumb enough to put his candidate in office. No doubt the Russian government has been working out how to collect on the debts that Trumpski owes it, as well as other holds it may have on him (sexual blackmail tapes from previous visits to Moscow, financing from Russian mob banks, etc.).

It goes some way to explaining why some of the early Trump moves have included weakening U.S. defence commitments to NATO and other allies, attacking U.S. trade agreements, and gutting U.S. intelligence agencies."
This law is absolutely asinine. All a business has to do is remove the women and men sign and place a new sign - Washroom or Restroom or Toilet.
"Trump spewed lies and misleading statements in his CPAC speech. For example, he disputed the Washington Post's statement that its report that Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador was based on “nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls.” How would Trump know how many sources there were — they were anonymous. And if it was ""fake news,"" why did he fire Flynn, based on what the Post reported?

Then, he claimed that ""Obamacare covers very few people,"" but, in fact, 20 million people have gained care under the ACA.

Also, he claimed that “In the Middle East, we’ve spent, as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion."" This is a wildly inaccurate number that includes future debt service (remember that Bush's wars were unfunded) and the cost of veterans' care for the next 30 years. 

And those are just a few of the lies that he told to an audience that believes it all."
"No, it's not 'there'.  And you can't provide any source.  It's a lie.

"Isn't Ron Soto, guilty of the same thing that the homeless are being sanctioned for? He's sitting in a public place with a sign, so what makes it okay for him and not okay for a homeless person? There certainly are different standards applied. If it's a public place then why is it illegal to be there at all? If loitering is not allowed then how do they define loitering and how long does it take for sitting or standing, to become loitering?

It's just a fact that people need to have a place to sleep, some where in close proximity to support services. Designate an area for the homeless and make them stay there. The US is good at that sort of thing. The Indians were put on reservations and killed if they came outside! I wonder just how many of our homeless, served this country and got a kick in the butt for doing so?"
A truly disgusting remark.  Sick minds abound among Trump haters.
"Your assumptions are silly. If people are dying from pot smoking, they are doing so now.

"""...For the sake of all that is good and righteous. Kill them all.""  Wow. There is a certain irony to that statement, given that Hitler thought pretty much the same about Jews and other so-called ""untermensch"". I think the Congressman missed the real point about events like the Holocaust: one must stop such destructive thinking in its tracks before it can do massive damage. Perhaps if the world, or at least if Germans, had responded forcefully to Hitler rather than believing in his message, those ovens would not exist. 

We need to look in the mirror in the USA and ask if we are capable of going down such a road ourselves. Categorizing all radicalized Islamists as worthy of death sounds an awful lot like deja vu all over again. Radicalization can be reversed. Indeed, we have less of a problem with radical Islam in the US than in Europe in part because we have not ostracized Muslims."
That's a ridiculous statement based on nothing.
"Junior is done in the next election regardless.  He's absolutely incompetent, and now with Trump just starting to beat him to a pulp over trade, Canadians will soon see the folly of electing a Sunny Ways Unicorn Herder  instead of a competent prime minister.  Can we please have Mr. Harper back?

"Dumbocrap hypocrites 

Hillary Clinton strategist Bob Beckel appeared on on Fox calling for the assassination of Julian Assange — a blatant urge for violence against the Wikileaks founder in direct contradiction of every possible natural and government law.

Wikileaks, of course, has published several damning caches of documents showing Clinton in none-too-favorable light — including emails from her controversially-employed private server as well as communications from the DNC which proved her campaign colluded with mainstream media.

“I mean, a dead man can’t leak stuff,” Beckel chillingly noted of Assange. “The guy’s a traitor, a treasonist, and … and he has broken every law in the United States. The guy ought to be — and I’m not for the death penalty — so, if I’m not for the death penalty, there’s only one way to do it, illegally shoot the son of a bitch.”"

"By ancestors of slaves in my comment above, I meant to type offspring. Of course most slaves also had slave ancestors, and most slaves had slave offspring. That is the nightmare of inter-generational slavery. At one point in history, I forget the date, it was estimated that a slave could look 7 generations back and find slave ancestors and with the benefit of a crystal ball, would be able to see 7 generations forward that would also be slaves. No other demographic in America or modern history has been subject to that unspeakable tyranny and inhumanity.

But it didn't end with slavery. Slaves also had ""free"" offspring and subsequent descendants who were subject to over a century and a half of anti-black discrimination, marginalization, exclusion, and terrorism. 

Enough celebration of white supremacy and tyranny. Let's stop erasing descendants of slaves to prop up descendants of white supremacists."
So Trump may screw up foreign policy through his ignorance and super-ego acting together.  I just hope that those who voted for him understand that running an oft failing company does not prepare one to be a politician let alone being a President.  Inaugurate him and then impeach him!
One good reason to vote for Trump. Hillary is a narcissistic sociopathic liar and those types of liberals are very dangerous.
"At the end of the day, should Boeing be successful in driving Bombardier to the point of bankruptcy, which is its obvious intent, the Chinese would be interested in making an offer that would mean that they would be able to have a jump start on creating an aircraft industry that would be able to compete with Boeing and Airbus while using its domestic market to ensure sales sufficient to justify production of new aircraft types, and the railroad division would be swallowed up into China's railcar operations. The Americans should be very careful about what for which they wish. The Canadian government is already very friendly towards China, and one could see how this could play out. Boeing could be starting China up as a major competitor as well as losing its Chinese market. Could the Chinese government already be rubbing its hands on the Americans' stupidity? They've already cornered the market on the railroad file. Aircraft could be next, if they were to get Bombardier."

Really?

Interesting how the comments on this article have to be civil, but the article doesn't. Thanks for being insulting and for your classist, ageist, wealthy old white guy perspective. Must have been nice being able to afford a house before you hit 30."

"This is such a garbage article. 
Most min-wage workers live with their parents or spouse in a multi-income household. 
Others are using the min-wage job as a stepping stone job while getting through college. 
For those who are trying to support a family singlehandedly with a min-wage job, there are already plenty of government programs to help them out.

If you raise the minimum wage you kill the incentive for the min-wage worker to ever improve his/her skills and get a better job."

First, the total percentages add up to much more than 100%
Second, Trump's disapproval rating of 55% is nothing to cheer about since that's what Obama had when he left office.
Third, even though the disapproval rating of Congress is 66%, you're comparing apples to oranges with Trump (1 person) vs. Congress (535 persons) as Congress has had a tougher and more complex job to do than Trump has had so far. 
Fourth, Congress isn't tweeting at all hours of the day and night or holding pep rallies for its known supporters across America to bolster its image and its egos.
Fifth, Congress has never been popular with the people.

But, most critically, what the Hell does a nebulous concept such as ""Approval"" really mean?

Only because Mr Trudeau was well briefed. For a hoot google 'trudeau trump handshake' to see how Mr Trump is just like that over-indulged commodity trader at the strip club. You know the one; he's just made a few bucks (on a stupidly risky trade) and thinks he's the alpha silverback in the forest, so he pulls (I mean really!) stupid dominance ploys on meeting real leaders.

"Having just read that Breibart is dissing McMaster now that Bannon has shown up back there, it may be that Trump recognized something in McMaster that Bannon lacked.

""Breitbart article,  ""H.R. McMaster Endorsed Book That Advocates Quran-Kissing Apology Ceremonies,"" claims that he threw his support behind a book advising U.S. military personnel to avoid desecrating the Quran, so as not to inflame religious tensions with Muslim populations in countries where American troops are deployed.
It also quotes a blurb for the book by McMaster, in which he writes that ""terrorist organizations use a narrow and irreligious ideology to recruit undereducated and disenfranchised people to their cause.""

Just considering McMaster's resume of two Bronze stars, a Silver Star, his history as an Armor Commander in the Battle of 73 Easting, his PhD where he questioned the military's role in Viet Nam under LBJ and McNamara, and the rest of his military history, Bannon is just a mouthy toad in comparison."

Trump was correct to identify the violence from both sides. But as they say “One man's terrorist is another man's Antifa.”."

"Are you reading the same article? Here, lets look at what it says....... 
 Andrew Weed, 48, received the sentence Wednesday for possession of child pornography....... The newer case stemmed from child porn downloaded at Weed's workplace last year and stored at his home, where investigators found more than 106,000 explicit images on May 31, 2016.

Next let's look at what the word defensive means....
a position or attitude of defense :
to be on the defensive about one's mistakes.

Looks like YOU'RE the defensive one Joe.
I, on the other hand, am opinionated. I walked in on my niece being molested, I helped put that sick, pathetic, looser in jail. If you're sympathetic to these sick freaks, well, you need to go get some mental help."

"Where does Don the lefty fascist come up with this rubbish? Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton praised Trump for his record with minorities in NYC. Once Trump became a presidential candidate, leftists like Don, foaming at the mouth, scream ""Racist!"" On but wait. It was Hillary Clinton who praised former Klansman and US Senator from West Virginia as ""her mentor."" Like a Pavlovian dog, Don simply parrots what the frail and quite pathetic Hillary Clinton spouts.  Trump speaks the truth about what the Left has delivered to inner city African-Americans: poverty, failed schools, and broken families. Who has been running  large US cities for decades? The only thing left in the Democrat playbook is to scream ""Racist!, Sexist! Homophobe!"" Hillary Clinton is guilty of numerous felonies for her gross mismanagement of classified material. Her husband is a serial rapist. Their greed and corruption are unmatched. And all poor, sickly Hillary and deranged Don can do is scream ""Racist."""

"In no way do I agree that Democrats haven't served working people, Lynn. You have a huge chip on your shoulder that blinds you when you conflate your friends with your enemies. Our federal government runs on consensus (when it runs at all) and not by diktat.

I will remember that folly to my dying day, and I think you oh-so-picky people have ushered in a huge disaster. You should have learned after Ralph Nader, but you didn't learn a damn thing; and it is you who will pay most dearly."

"amazing how simple minded fools belittle my mother's accomplishments, especially after she spent 40+ years fighting for better safety laws protecting blue collar workers. You're not going to find anything on the subject today as for the last 30 years there has been a war on tobacco. Everything written on the subject  covers a heavy smoker., which as I stated is quite harmful and especially for asthma. Before inhalers and drugs, doctors-nurses prescribed 1 cigarette a day to help asthma patients as you will find all over Google, people who attest a smoke helped them breath easier. That's 1 a day, not 20. this is why back in the 60's my mother told patients to do just that, which was common, not because of big tobacco as your delusions allude to when demonizing the industries she worked for with grade school tripe."

"The question remains what Trump's ties to Russia really are and how much he is in the pocket of Putin.

"Rubbish.  The entire surface area of the reservoir is 4,000 Ha, or 40 square kilometres, (20 Km  x 2 Km.) That's roughly double the surface area of the river at present. The area to be flooded represents 0.4% of Ag land in the Peace River district and 0.2% of Ag land in BC.  If that will feed 1 million, the balance of Peace River Ag land can feed almost 140 million Canadians. 

Alternative energy sources? A  windmill has a 20 year lifespan. A dam's electrical generation capacity is approximately 100 years.  The Paris accord requires CO2 cuts of 30% by 2030, the transportation sector which contributes 27% of CO at present, must be electrified. The claim that we can rely on the Columbia River (USA) dam's capacity is foolish. When Trump says America First, it means everyone else last. The only energy security we can count on is our domestic supply.

Finally, blowing off about $5 billion to mothball a $9  or $10 billion project is astoundingly stupid."

The AIIB target is 100 member countries and looks like this will happen. How's that for leadership by a 'communist totalitarian regime'. Your choice of word only tell me of your ignorance and dogma brain of a Trump. Do yourself a favor and purge."
"Sally, you ignorant hack, the President is empowered by the Constitution to do EXACTLY what you say he can't. The Attorney General, nor the Director of the FBI are independently elected.

"Yes, it is asinine to dismiss the entire conversation as stupid. These are very real and complex issues that aren't going to be solved by saying people should just get the right training or pick up their boot straps.

What does this say for working parents, or other people with fixed incomes and limited time? How should they acquire the necessary training to compete for a limited number of high-tech jobs? If denied education, their remaining choices are to go on welfare that depends on their unemployed status, or work in low quality jobs (quality having been driven down by the large amount of competition for the remaining jobs). Neither of these is a good option - quite frankly why should anyone want work their hands to the bone in dead-end jobs so the economy can screw them? The capitalist argument frequently forgets it's most potent weapon: incentive. 

UBI does not pay people not to work. It supplements income to guarantee security and inject market confidence."

"Russia is a ""thug"" of a nation that has been run by totalitarians for a long time. From the Czar and his ministers through to Stalin and the Communists. Now it is the ""mobster"" Putin running the show. I am certain that it is far more likely that Russia ""fixes"" its own elections rather than having to deal with ""outsiders"" trying to cause problems. They've been doing it as a ""democracy"" for some time now. Little Putin is a thug. A Russian thug. And while I am sure there are millions of fine, decent honorable Russians, there are far more who aren't that way. From the wealthiest to the poorest in Russia , it is money that talks. Widespread corruption from the Baltic to the Pacific. Huge country. Nasty bunch."
"I just don't understand this Republican Party.

That's why we see assaults to voting rights, free speech, equal rights, peaceful protest, etc. Attempts to control the expression of sexuality among consenting adults is another way authoritarian governments attempt to control the population. Controlling access to healthcare, education, equal justice, and participation in the economy by paying fair, living wages are other attempts at control.

"""Are Donald Trump’s threats just the art of the deal?"" Finally someone from the Globe is getting it, or at least printing it.

While he might be no friend to many, it is exactly that the USA needs and they know it. They need a leader that will not foot the bill for every cause, every movement and every country! NATO will be fine, but any country not pulling their weight will be told AND rightly so! Canada included! apparently according to the Globe, the Canadian economy if larger than Russia's....so why is our military so puny in comparison?

Second, find someplace secluded to do the drugs. A conscious, premeditated choice.

Third, melt the drugs or dissolve them into a solution. A conscious, premeditated choice.

Fourth, fill the syringe with the drugs. A conscious, premeditated choice.

Fifth, find a vein, between the toes to avoid detection or in the elbow. A conscious, premeditated choice.

Sixth, inject the drugs. A conscious, premeditated choice.

That's at least six conscious, well planned, premeditated choices, all designed to inject lethal chemicals into the body.

If they don't give a flying F.... about their life why the heck should anyone else?"
"Just like our Native Americans....these wild horses were here first....and we, of the self-absorbed, all-important, worshipers of the ALMIGHTY DOLLAR, feel it is our 'right' to take away their freedom and shove them aside in the name of PROFIT.  These animals have assisted mankind....been enslaved by mankind....have given their all in our military and the MANY other ways that they have served humans.  And for their service...NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED as the TOTAL MISMANAGEMENT of these herds, by the Bureau of Land MISmanagement, has resulted in over population (THE BLM'S MISTAKE) and their way to ""fixing"" their mistake is to erase it and act as if it did not happen.  PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS SLAUGHTER BECOME A HORRIFIC REALITY....it speaks VOLUMES as to our lack of humanity....no surprise.  How many heartless bastards does it take to slaughter thousands of helpless wild animals....apparently the views and feelings of the MAJORITY OF AMERICANS does not matter to them.  SHAME SHAME ON U"
"Graykeeper, For some reason I feel you have lived here for a long time. Don't know, just a hunch.   Remember back when the abbreviation for Alaska, when addressing mail, was ""R.A.""? It stood for ""Russian America"".  You can still find it on old envelopes.
Moving on: I don't know much about politics and their inner workings (my parents and grandparents taught me that ALL politicians are crooks who must be avoided and that everything they promise if elected is a complete lie since it seldom comes to fruition) but I am getting the impression a party divided is not a good thing. Not only does it strike me as silly and disorganized to elect someone and then try to force them to quit, but I am reminded of ""united we stand, divided we fall.""  I think they should let the voters decide who they want to elect and then stand by it. Other wise what's the point of the whole operation???
Just my humble opinion."

"Some government is good, particularly national defense, infrastructure, education, and protection of its citizens from harmful products made by companies, but most government is bad and unnecessary. 

Our federal budget should be closer to 2 trillion, not the 3.8+ trillion it is today. We take in approx. 3.2 trillion in revenue from citizens, yet overspend 600 billion per year, year in and year out. Why? That needs to change. We waste more than 300 billion a year on paying interest on the national debt. Do you know what we could do with that money every year? The worst part is, we never touch the principle. We will be paying that $300 billion (which will rise) forever. Talk about pathetic."

"I'm not sure what is more disheartening, electing the preferred candidate of white supremacists to be president in the 21st century, or that most white liberals are too ignorant of our history, feckless, and self absorbed to acknowledge how bad and common white racism is in all aspects of our society. The one good thing about white folks, as a group, is that their children tend to be less racist than their elders. Unfortunately, they are still producing folks like Dylan Roof too. We had a saying back in the 1960's and 1970's that is still true today. ""We are not where we want to be, and we not where we are going to be, but thank God we are not where we use to be."" There is nothing about American history I want to relive. There are no good old days back there for me."

"When Gretchen Carlson and Megan Kelly and a dozen others accused Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly, and Eric Bolling of sexual harassment, we learned that for decades it was an open secret at Fox News that they were predators.  The sanctimonious right kept quiet.  Even when these whales were harpooned, they stayed silent.  
When an anti-abortion Republican congressman was caught demanding his mistress have an abortion, Caldera was dumb as a post. 
When Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was accused of sexually abusing 3 underage male students, Caldera was dumb as a post.
When Trump was accused by 17 women of sexual harassment during the campaign and bragged that because he was rich, he was entitled to sexual assault any woman he wanted, Caldera was dumb as a post. 
Could it be that Caldera and the right have a double standard on acceptance of sexual harassment?"

"I understand.  The abuse is not that they can't vote however they want.  The abuse is that there is absolutely NO, ZERO evidence that the Russians did anything. They have no evidence of anything, and are now going after anyone who ever met Trump out of desperation. LOL! How do you change an election if you do not change the voting results, machines, hacking the software, etc.  Are they not allowed to have an opinion one way of the other?  They had one show IN RUSSIA on our election.  I don't think even one American voter saw it, so how did this change the election in trump's favor?  The fact is, it didn't.  And Wikileaks was not given anything by Russia.  That is a fact. The dems have to have an excuse why Hillary, the worst candidate in history, who cheated, lied, stole, did everything you can do to wipe out Bernie, and then she stole 6 states, and was about to steal 5 others when the NSA stepped in and took control in the election between she and Trump.

"Carter was feckless. His embargo of Iranian oil in response to the kidnapping and imprisonment of the entire US Iranian diplomatic corps resulted in hording, which drove up gas prices and caused shortages. His rescue by helicopter of the embassy staff ran into a sandstorm, grounding the helicopters. The stagflation, a structural problem, was solved by Fed chairman Paul Volcker, but didn't kick in until Reagan took office, after Reagan had promised to sell Ayatollah Komeini banned missiles, the profit from which went to the Nicaraguan Contras from Ollie North's office in the White House basement. Remember that?

Carter was the most decent man in the White House in the last 100 years. As The Donald would say, Nice people are losers. I guess that's the way you feel, Motley, when you're not thinking about how common criminals are losers. So, who's NOT a loser?"

"This may be the dumbest and most naive piece of pap I've ever read. As a foreign government, there is little we can do to exercise influence over any other country, let alone the U.S. You may have noticed that nobody cared that Mr. Trudeau was there other than Canadians. We can't control their immigration policy. We can't control their economic agenda. We can't control their view on diversity. We can exercise some influence over trade because we trade with them on a very significant level.

The women's leadership roundtable was brilliant, working through the back door to achieve influence.

We have to live with this guy (Trump) for the next 4 years, at least, so we need to start with small achievements. 

If you want to tell Mr. Trump how to behave vis-a-vis the citizens of the country of which he is president, you should feel to exercise your influence over him. I'm sure he'd be interested."
"Entrapment or not Mohamed's intentions were clear, he wanted to murder innocent people and families.  You either want to murder people or you don't, someone who does not want to be a terrorist and kill innocent people would not fall into entrapment.  In my opinion Mohamed is missing a chromosome, he flirted with the idea of becoming a jihad before this so-called entrapment, obviously the idea of being with Allah was far more appealing than living free in the greatest Country on Earth.

Democrats and Hillary made a statement about sexual predators when they voted in favor of Billy being elected even though the knowledge of the mans sexual deviance was laid out to the entire country.  Democrats make a statement in favor of gross sexual perversion when they support and defend gays and lesbians.  They make a statement about sexual perversion when they agree that a sexually deviant woman should be allowed to kill her own baby. They made a statement to the entire world when a transgender spoke at the democratic convention setting the example for all of our children that law and order does not matter and your feelings trump anything.

To navigate successfully from point A to point B using non-instrument or Celestial navigation, you must know point B exists and you must know the positioning of the sun, moon, stars and planets along the route.  The first Polynesians to arrive in our islands had no idea they existed and would not have known the positioning of celestial bodies to guide them, so they could not have used non-instrument navigation to find Hawaii.

"If you remember the reason Iran hates us so much is we kept The Shah of Iran in power a long time even though he was a bad guy. We had a plan to put explosives into Castro's cigars. The Bay of Pigs. I remember we screwed with a lot of countries leaders to keep big companies of USA oppressing the little guy. We got our start overthrowing tyranny but for big business we exported tyranny. Drugs for guns Contra scandal. The list is endless. During the Viet Nam war we bought all the opium crop one year to keep the drug lords on our side. That opium still made it to market. In Afghanistan the Taliban stopped opium production for a year but when we went in we supported the drug lords to get them on our side. Afghanistan then became the world biggest producer of opium again. That opium makes it to market also. To me, opium is a weapon of mass destruction. The Russians leaked what was in the emails, they didn't make them up. In the world of hardball politics, that was a softball."
Don't bring your dumb alt-right vocab into this country. Thanks.

I agree it's going nowhere. But... People like you that moan about your PFD getting ""stolen"" make yourself look sad and ignorant. Get a better job if you really need the few hundred bucks...

"The bilious hyperbole of the Trump camp and their Canadian sycophants is amazing.  If you think Trump's going to lead you to the land of milk and honey and you'll feast on locusts... just head south... His move to ease restrictions on the USA's banks is simply a disaster waiting to happen - but I doubt you remember 2008 especially well. Letting the wolves and jackals of Wall Street act with impunity;  shedding fiduciary responsibility to investors they have advised is reprehensible and ethically bankrupt. Greed is good is once more the hallowed refrain! This crazy run up in the markets is coming down some time soon, the fundamentals have not changed that much. To hell with a generation and more of efforts to environmental protection - they're open for business but Nordstrom's doesn't want their crap..."

"The liberal ""politically correct"" ethos is drowning out even Muslims that want to help and condemn this type of brutal violence by their most radical flanks --I think they call this irony. No law abiding, responsible Muslim citizen wants their children involved with these insidious terrorist groups; no more than white parents want their kids in neo-Nazi gangs, or black parents want their kids hanging around with the Bloods and Crips. Let Muslims help by speaking out and identifying these radical elements within their community, so let's please not sacrifice more innocent blood in the name of politeness and pretend that we don't see any differences in our multicultural societies.  The West must help reformist moderate Muslims reform Islam, this is one of the most important issues of our time."
This sounds like the same garbage we heard from the pro-tobacco lobbyists in the 60's.
If all NRA members are culpable then all Muslims are also equally culpable of other acts of terrorism because they all believe  the same  ideology.
Why anyone would pay to hear this repulsive woman talk is beyond me.
"Ms Norton has no interest in a political position in Colorado because Colorado has no interest in her.

It's borderline treasonous, especially given the fact that were BC to have a huge earthquake, along with a huge hit to its economy, I doubt that the rest of Canada would ever be quite so isolationist, unsupportive and uncooperative in terms of helping fellow British Columbians to rebuild and get their economy back on track.

The only one worse is Bennett, who voted against lowering drug prices for his bag of loot from the pharmaceutical industry. 

This is oligarchy, folks, and we voted for it in the US Senate.  Let's kick both of these jerks to the curb!"
It's not a choice if one was born there you idiot.
What a bloody train wreck.  The dipsy doo Dems win by default through GOP raw selfishness.
"How about Hillary Clinton who not only stayed with Bill but supported him through his lies?
Maybe if Bill Clinton had not been the darling of the Democratic Party, considered a respected elder statesman, who has been given numerous awards, honors, and a total pass on his sexual assault and sexual harassment of young women over his entire political career, maybe Trump would never have gotten away with running. 
What kind of message did that send all the good old boys out there Bill got away with an His buddies Harvey and Epstein, the millionaire convicted sex offender who Bill Clinton took repeated trips with on the "" Lolita Express"", with girls as young as 12 years old. 
Then sicko buddy, Anthony Weiner, husband of Hillary's top aide and friend. Bill and Anthony were known to enjoy each other's company.
So, all the men and women who voted for Hillary did not seemed bothered about putting  a sex abuser and confirmed perjurer, Bill Clinton back into the White House either, did they ?"

"Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't a lot of black people vote for Trump?  I am no Trump supporter and believe the only reason he got elected was because the best the Democrats could offer was Hillary, but Trumps message resonated with a lot working people of all races. 
Now I also find it disgustingly egocentric for Andra Gillespie to act as if she is speaking for all black Americans.  She isn't."
Actually it were the red states that let America down.  I mean come on.  How could anyone vote for the town butcher to perform brain surgery. This really has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative but rather intelligence and knowledge vs ignorance and plain stupidity.  Stupidity won.  Congratulations Trump supporters.
"Trump supporters are, at heart, cowards controlled by their fears (and played like tools by Herr Drumpf).  As Ben Franklin noted ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety"" . . .  sadly in the supposed Land of the Free and Home of the Brave we have tens of millions of sheep who trip over themselves to give away freedoms as fast as they can in exchange for Big Government promising them an illusion of safety.  This is just more of the same, another mile marker on the long, sad decline of this nation that cowardice has brought us to."
"“wacky & totally unhinged,”

Now THAT is a great description of Trump himself.  If the Loser in Chief can't be impeached then we must pray that 2020 comes quickly so we can rid ourselves of this incompetent nutbag."
"During this entire cluster f*ck of an investigation and media storm, I'm still amazed by how the average American is treated as a complete dolt. Set aside 2016, Russia has interfered in every presidential election for the last 50+ years. Most powerful nations have attempted to sway the outcome in their favor, and who wouldn't try when we're talking about the most influential country in history. Also, our own governemnt gets it's hand wet whenever a country holds elections, in hopes of a favorable outcome.

But nooo, we must act shocked that such an act has been perpetrated and question it's motives in relation to Trump's ascension to power.  The American people are treated as fools, being told where to focus their outrage and blinded to the overall geopolitical goals every nation with the means would aspire to control. I'm so very tired of this. I feel such shame, since I'm certain the media and Democrats will show none once this whole cluster f*ck goes away."

Good heaven's I see the posting board is full of bleeding hearts. China can go pound sand! Good on President-elect Trump for initiating a tone that puts these totalitarian scum bags back in their place.
"No, I'm afraid the voters are stupid. Mind-numbingly stupid.

It's getting ridiculous when party lines trump common sense. When the second amendment was written there was only single shot weapons and no one could carry a cannon and I'm sure that had the forefathers could have seen the pushing to the limit of every freedom the Constitution would have been written differently. Party lines and people that can't think for themselves are disgusting and so are owning weapons of mass killings. Used to be a person was proud of being able to only use one shot and now it's being proud of how many shots one can fire, stupid!!"
"anyone who trusts these guys to effectively manage a new infrastructure bank need only look at Ontario where they simply did whatever the heck they wanted to, with other peoples money.  When things didn't work out right, they simply poured more money into it.  That is exactly what will happen with this.  Government cannot stimulate an economy effectively with more money. They simply choose winners, and therefore losers. The winners have the lobbyists and the money to get to ""have dinner"" with the ministers.  The losers, well, they don't matter. At the end of the day, the money will be gone, and my generation, my kids generation, and their kids generation will be stuck with the bills.  funny, on one hand the government is requiring money to save the planet, for the sake of the future generations, all the while knowing the carbon plan won't make any difference at all in the world, and on the other hand is willing to shackle our citizens with debts they cannot every pay. Pathetic."

"Nothing will happen now until the results of next month's election are known.

My money is on Mayor Nenshi. Ken King is about as maladroit as it gets when it comes to playing politics in the full glare of an election campaign."
We the people of Ontario have failed ourselves and future generations when we elected the most incompetent politicians in Canadian history. We failed to see the complete folly of the Green Energy Act. We failed see the corruption. We failed see that their reckless spending is about to bankrupt us. We failed to see that social engineering merely masks our true problems driving industry away at break neck speed. Sorry Canada for our stupidity.

Can't say I blame Portis for how he feels."
He's 85.  He'll live the rest of his life sleeping on top of a giant pile of cash.  They should have tossed him 25 years ago and saved many women the humiliation of satisfying that fat pig or being fired.

I think Mr. Stewart was trying to dispel the facts about Vietnamese refugees with ignorance and use it as a platform to not support (Syrian/Muslim) immigration in the US.

(And, yes, I have had that experience and know other women who have had it also). These fearful and unfair people who think their body shouldn't be under public display of the opposite sex will  get used to being goggled and their daughters won't even think it's unusual and the whole world will be better off for them getting used to being sexually harassed. And, hey, the occasional sexual molestation of children ... that will only grow the number of transgendered, so it will meet your goal and that means there's nothing to worry about."
its bad and unbelievable they way the democrats are trying to destroy democracy. are you kidding not 1 day goes by without some foolish accusation unproven and silly. and the press and Hollywood  make all sorts of attacks.. no country treats its leaders this way. not even isis and hitler didnt have it this bad

"In light of Trump's executive order opening up coal fields and mines in the U.S. to use coal again for 
industrial purposes yesterday, it seems stupid to me for Canada to have carbon tolls for the electorate
at all!     Just as was said before the tax was implemented, it would be another way for the governments
to remove more money from the electorate, in order for it to be wasted.     So now we can get more acid
rain, carbon etc in the atmosphere, blowing over to us.     And what can federally, provincially, municipally can be done to protect us?"

Wait another 7 years until her then-daughter turns 18 so you can abuse her too? Gross. Get away."
"Please name one instance -- just one -- when anybody was prohibited by law from saying 'Merry Christmas.' This is the most ludicrous non-issue Trump has ginned up, and that's saying something!

"The bishops long ago hitched their wagon to the RNC to keep the attention of the one-percent and their largesse. If the past election taught us anything it is that many 'Christians' are hypocrites. One can add the USCCB to that cabal. Abortion rates drop under Democrats and rise under Republicans. Why? Because the latter create a toxic social environment. We are seeing more evidence of that with the increase in IUDs provided through Planned Parenthood since Trump's election . The bishops, like their evangelical brethren, ignore the evidence but 'facts' are hard to dispute. As long as we have bishops who 'smell like the 1%' rather than 'smell like the sheep' we will see decreasing influence of the bishops on mainstream Catholics social attitudes and teachings will be completely ignored. We all have 'Religious Freedom"" and many of us may express it by ignoring the bishops."

What is wrong with you ? How can you make such a dumb statement in that Trump is doing everything he can to impede the Russian investigation ? If what you say is true he'd fire Mueller.for hiring all those Clinton supporting lawyers who would probably work for free at the chance of hurting Trump  .   You ought to be giving Trump a chance after all the good he's doing for Alaska after having only been in office for months.  IF I were Trump I'd never have let Alaska get 50 million to help with fish and game.

What we have seen since Trump became president is a never ending attack by liberals on anything Trump says or does. It is anti-Trumpism, plain and simple.

No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. ... The Constitution defines treason as specific acts, namely ""levying War against [the United States], or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.

And no nothing being done or said here meets that definition.    

On the other hand we did manage to get all the Trump Derangement Syndrome folks in the same place.  So far it’s a who’s who of far left, looney left and leftists who pretend to be Republicans making up most of the thread and all of the nonsense."

"No, not really. I think the majority of Americans see the truth of what's going on. Only the few blithering idiots like yourself that support Trump no matter what don't see the truth of the matter. Trump is a complete failure as President.

"This is a really ugly thread of comments.  To be sure, it's easy to criticize the student ""protest"" as juvenile and ineffective...and shouting ""F#$% Trump"" is less than polite or respectful.  However, I find it less offensive than spending eight years calling the President a ""stupid N#%#$%,"" which was the pasttime of thousands of right-wing bloggers.  

Candidate Trump, indeed, made promises which are threatening to many groups of Americans and stirred the flames of discontent among both his followers and those who opposed his election.  He is IMO,  the most polarizing figure in modern American political history.  Protest marches addressing his election shouldn't surprize anyone.  

The real question now focuses the difference between campaign rhetoric and Presidential action.  If, in fact, a President Trump actually attempts to enact all his campaign promises, we are, indeed, facing at least four years of extreme political conflict.  We are now ""a house divided"".... (cont)"

He could jump in the water to save a drowning child and the story would be:  ""The President Puts Himself and the Country at Risk Trying to Save Child.""  What a bunch of dimwits."

"The biggest problem with Islam is not the teachings in the Quran, though it is steeped in narrow-minded Old Testament values. It is the confusion of brutal, racist, backwards Arabic culture with the true teachings of Islam. Arabic culture is the main problem, both in the US muslim community and Islamic countries worldwide.

Islam needs reform to purge itself of Arabic culture.  It could start by promoting translations of the Quran, prayer and scholarship into non-Arabic language, and rejection of Imams from Arabic countries. African-American muslims could take the lead on this.

And Muslims might want to learn more about Christ's teachings in the Gospel."

They don't have concern for other's potential problems, unless they can right a story about it, safely, from the comfort of their office, without getting sued or looking stupid.

Tenney regularly to express my concerns for those people. I intend to keep doing that, civilly as always. 
 I hope that at some point Rep. Tenney will practice civility to the point of not blaming all Democrats for the horrible actions of a small number of unbalanced people.

"Just how little has changed was driven home for me on Friday when I heard that Trump again referred to Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” in his speech to the NRA. I understand that he’s afraid of Warren; he always has been. I also understand that he thinks her claim to have a Native American heritage presents a political opportunity for her opponents -- but his use of the name of a Native American hero as a slur demeans him and the presidency. During the election, I sometimes referred to Trump as “Dirty Donald”, imitating his proclivity for naming his political foes (Little Marco, Lyin’ Ted, Crooked Hillary, etc.); it seemed appropriate shorthand for a man who has lived a filthy life personally, professionally and politically. I discontinued the reference on November 9, not because I suddenly acquired respect for him, but because I do respect the office to which he was elected. It’s too bad he doesn’t respect it. What a despicable, filthy, cowardly, petty little man this president is."

"garycrum - Satoshi Kanazawa is a low IQ leftwing nutjob and racist.  That fully explains why you suckered for his biased research, thereby quantifying my hypothesis regarding Democrats.  

Your man Satoshi also publicly proclaimed that Black women are the least attractive group among all humans.    As a result, the largest student organization in London (representing 120,000 students) unanimously called for Kanazawa's dismissal from your London school.  His work has been roundly criticized and soundly debunked by his peers.

"Continued. damn character limit.....

5. Islamic State. By 2008 the volatile Middle East region had quieted significantly. The Obama administration abandoned a long standing U.S. policy regarding foreign dictators and goons (He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch) and threw Mubarak under the bus. The President then signed off on an ill-advised plan to overthrow Khadafy. Mr. Obama drew a red line for Assad and failed to back up his tough talk. These destabilizing acts turned the “Arab Spring” into a bloody nightmare of anarchy
6. Trump. Heads we lose, tails we lose."
"I knew this wouldn't happen, as liberals need this lie

"Hey HappyGuy, just so you know, I subscribe for entertainment and I use it in my doggie poop/pee tray.  Stop acting so righteous.  You complain like a weenie about Trump, but you live in the U.S."
"Perhaps it is time to pause and reflect why the Liberals were turfed out the last time. Adscam, the sponsorship scandal, Shawinigate and I'm entitled to my entitlements are some of the many reasons why. I'm surprised they are back at it so quickly.
If anyone thinks government business is not being discussed for $1500, they are a primary candidate for the sunny ways certificate of stupidity."
"I still don't understand people's antipathy towards Hillary Clinton. For years the Republicans have denigrated her, and that effort has been ramped up moreso lately by Trump. But I would think people would take that as what it is: propaganda. Partisanship and ideology aside, what has she really done to deserve such an unfavourable opinion?

As a career public servant, she would have by necessity made a number of mistakes and miscues, and having survived this long, she must clearly have learned from her mistakes. 

To take the word of a known fibber, and come on, what has Trump ever really said that was factual, accurate, truthful and unbiased? - as he claims his opponent is a liar, the devil, a traitor, a criminal, and has hate in her heart, and accuses her relentlessly of the worst things possible...this surely must be the antithesis of critical thinking.

It is of concern that so many American voters are failing in their civic duty to honestly appraise their presidential candidates."
The turnips are reading from the party manual again . Trump ( Sweden terror attack ) needs to be deposed swiftly He is buying drugs from Eugene's local drug dealers or he is mentally insane or both
"Bravo! Yes, Trudy is a phony and a tax cheat, a vacuous one, but still a phony and a tax cheat."
"If I were on the School board, I would fire them.  They are either too arrogant or too stupid for their current positions and there are lots more where they came from.

"Wow!  The ""deplorables"" just gave the political and media elite a big middle finger."
"The SACP are a bunch of hyporcrits. All along they have been singing Zuma's praises, doing his bidding and turning a blind eye to all the corruption and looting that was taking place. Looking at the podium, during their conference, one can see many cabinet ministers and deputies.  They have all been singing from the same song sheet whilst usurping the bling in the ANC led government. 

And now they try the 'holier than thou' trick. With Jeremy Cronin wailing about 'what went wrong'?

Nxesi conducted the sham (inter minsiterial) investigation to get Zuma off the hook on paying for Nkandla.

It was not long ago that Blade Nzimande was praising the Gupta's and slipping in diversion tricks by pretending that they were bona-fida businessmen.

The SACP have been part and parcel to the rot that has set in. They cannot now distance themselves from the catestrophic mess of state capture. Blaming the Gupta's and simulateneously absolving Zuma does not cut. It takes two to tango."
"Good point. It's hopeless. We should all just shoot ourselves. We've got the guns.
Seriously, all of the situation we are in was created by the voting public. Since the hanging chad election of George Bush we've had an accelerated erosion of one person, one vote. Giving up is not an answer. 
We've had a hard lesson just how obstructionist Congress can be. Placing a candidate in the oval office that can galvanize the people is an excellent start. For some reason people question Sanders' ability to get things done, but not Trump. Either will face opposition. 
We need 2/3rds of that 535 congressional members to propose an amendment, then 3/4ths of states to ratify.  We have passed 17 amendments. 
I am not giving up before we try."
I wish they had a system that rejects idiot posts like this one.

"Difference is I back up my oddball stories with facts which you can't refute.  Disparaging them isn't the same as refuting.

"Trump and Co are greedy morons. The time will come when they will profoundly regret their greed. Their stupidity on the other hand is something they will regret but can never remedy. That's just how they are: as intelligent as fence-posts. They are as dense about their economy as they are about the health and well-being of their citizens. If they pass this stuff into law, they are toast."
"1st they said the would hit the PFE so they wouldn't have to tax us, know they take the PFD and want to tax us. Total BS, just like the past election when they said they were retiring bonds so the new ones wouldn't cost us anything. And the dumb a$$ voters fell for it. Is our property taxes staying the same? NO they are going UP. Why not propose a sales tax instead of an income tax? That way everyone pays the same percentage on what they buy. Not just the working people. Alaska was gotten so f'd up over the past 10 years I cannot get out fast enough. The low life welfare, live in the middle of nowhere to get subsidized, live on the backs of the working people have ruined a wonderful place. It is simply just a sh-t hole, welfare, snowflake state."

"Exactly......we have a very biased, manipulative media......and they wonder why people don't trust them.....always thinking we stooges are to stupid to see what they have been up to."
"The past tense of 'beget' is 'begot,' Comrade. If the Obama presidency was such a failure, why did Clinton, a candidate with much baggage and a woman to boot, garner almost 3 million more votes than Trump ? Maybe the begetting of Trump had much more to do with Putin's role in the U.S. election than did the imagined failures of the Obama administration. Maybe certain kinds of Americans are more loyal to their backward ideas than they are to the nation they inhabit and its democratic institutions. Maybe these pro-Putin dupes are the dregs of American society, their patriotism all show and no substance."

"I can only imagine just being touched by this repulsive thing , never mind raped."
"Trump: ""I don't believe it."" Based on what? Gut feeling or just denial that something might just be there? Something could have truely happen without his knowing. That would be actually believable but to just say ""I don't believe it"" leads a reasonable person to think you are covering up. Buffoon.

"Privatizing profits and socializing costs is one of the core concepts behind crony capitalism.  And it's why this nation is headed to the ash heap of history* without serious reforms to break the back of the oligarchy that has seized control quietly since the Reagan-Clinton years.

"Shakedown, right out of Clinton Foundation Inc.  

Trudeau, an arrogant  clown."
"Donald Trump is spending this morning of his vacation lamenting the removal of various monuments to treason in defense of slavery:
One thing I’ve been surprised by during this slow motion car crash into a raging dumpster fire is the sheer depth of Trump’s stupidity and ignorance.
You could tell during Tuesday’s press conference that he thought he had come up with a new and especially powerful argument when he lectured the reporters about the previously unappreciated fact — no doubt just relayed to him by an advisor in the previous day or two — that Washington and Jefferson owned slaves (wait until he finds out that Jefferson liked to rape some of his).
On top of everything else, he’s just really really dumb — and of course he remains blissfully unaware of this."

The problem is that you have three useless/obsolete degrees.

"Conservative Christians have the power.
Conservative Christians can't stand the fact gay people have the same rights as them. They want to restore their former power imbalance that was in favor of them.
Conservative Christians want the right to discriminate against gay people, on religious grounds.

"The guy is making a fool of himself every single day so, quite frankly, it's not inappropriate for anyone to call him out on it.

"Munoz is a great example of how out of touch with reality the majority of our politicians really are. Any baby raping s.o.b. should be locked away for as long as the law will allow, period. There are no socially redeeming qualities within anyone who would harm a child in any way and at the top of the list is a child rapist(Jack) or someone who would facilitate the rape of a child (Hauge). What Munoz has done to the victims of these horrible crimes is nearly as bad as the crime itself in that they are being told that what happened to them does not matter, that in fact they do not matter. If it is possible for a politicrit to feel shame then Munoz should feel extremely ashamed of herself and do everyone a favor and resign (fat chance) and apologize to the victims in person (again, fat chance). There is one way to show Munoz the error of her idiotically misguided ways and that would be to vote this moron out next election. Remember the victims and help them and not the predator criminals."
"And you are racist for not caring about Black Flights! Oh yeah, and a bigot to boot. Have I covered everything?"
"They  ran away from college because they couldn't handle the changing demographic. They are just putting themselves at a huge disadvantage in the future. Talk about cutting off you nose to spite your face.  This attitude is mirrored in many Trump supporters. Instead of adapting, they blame immigrants, refugees, minorities, women, media and the left. I certainly agree college isn't for everyone but leaving because your felling are hurt is kind of pathetic."

But it's fun to see Mufi on tv crying about the taxes HE CAUSED and now let's watch Cadwell turn tricks in Chinatown dressed as a woman with his man panties on - dance, Cadwell, dance.

"The malignant narcissist, mentally warped sociopath, pathological liar and draft dodger, has now revealed himself to be not only a bigot and racist, but a closet fascist. The man spews nothing but excrement from his stinking swamp and proclaims himself president. He is nothing more than a disgusting, semi-ignorant, loud-mouthed fool in an empty suit. The sooner he is thrown out of the WH, the sooner this country can truly be great again."
Yet he refuses to have a town hall and meet with his constituents.  He refuses to open the door to his Issaquah office during business hours.  He wants to take away people's health insurance.  He also refuses to listen to his district and ignores their views to further endear himself to Republican Leadership and Donald Trump.  It's time to throw the bum out.
Time to flag yourself as a hate monger.

All he did was extend his stick outward, the puck deflected into the net. To hear these bottom feeders announcers, it was like the second coming of Christ. Please people, settle down, it was a deflection. They were even talking about his superhuman strength to be able to accomplish such an easy deflection. Are you kidding me.

You're too willing to dismiss justice for victims of sexual assault as though we as a society shouldn't be troubled by having to convict rapists because, you know, it's just the women who are the victims (mostly) so why should anyone care?

And they really did not care that Ted was a Canadian up til about 2 years ago. 

So.. The choice evangelicals have today- Trump who appears genuine or Hillary who has a long list of dead bodies, supports abortion, and is a loose trigger.  As the damning emails are released on the DNC and Hillary in particular, the choice is not really hard.  American or a Stalin wannabe.. Make your choice."

We are your customers, we loved La Loma, now you got your dough and you want to be the Hudson Valley of I-25. Go for it, you are making a big mistake. If we wanted a Route 9 New York CIA joint, we have several to choose from. We know food, we travel, we have money! But we don't want New York crap food! All we wanted was La Loma. You want to Re-invent yourself into some crap NY junk!
By the way, the CIA takes anyone with a GED!"
"This is ridiculous.  It's not like he was buying himself surfboards, going to nightclubs or on family vacations.  It is/was to support a community activity.  Why would this be a bad thing to support a healthy lifestyle (other than the possible after game refreshments) lifestyle and community involvement?"

"Absolutely!  I agree completely. Canada needs to stop letting in all (non-white) people from around the world.  Enough is enough.  (non-white) People from the around the world should not be allowed to own property in Canada.  Only (white) Canadian people should be.  

Enough is enough."
Jews who supported Trump are as loathsome as gays like Peter Thiel or transgendered people like Caitlyn Jenner who did so. I have no use for any of them.

"Has someone added a person to the Godhead, maybe Ashura, the ancient wife of Yaweh? That would be heresy (unless the whole Church through council agrees to it. Correcting how we use natural law reason is not heresy (by taking away the supposed superior competence of the Pope, reason be damned). The consequence, of course, would be reinterpretation of certain moral questions. I can't wait either, but I think we need the asexuals in the clergy to out themselves (like Burke) and apologize for imposing their natural instincts on the rest of us, who don't share their peculiar natures."
"Hey Skier.......  my sentiments exactly.  I never go to Walmart anymore...  for many reasons (wage disparity etc.,) but partly because as one walks thru it, one sees the unnecessary plastic garbage people randomly throw into their carts..   Same with dollar stores;  these junk shops just wreak of plastic shite.    Who dreams up all this rubbish that is shipped over in massive containers, I often wonder..   
     We need to have a heavy push by provincial governments to seriously consider changing our

"""Been to LA lately? It looks like Mexico City."" 

As you probably know that part of the country used to belong to Mexico.  There are people of Mexican, Spanish and/or indigenous (mostly a mix of all three) heritage that have lived in Los Angeles for probably longer than your ancestors have been in the US.  If you are so concerned about those who are there illegally then a simple solution is to make many legal and stop the rest from illegally working by going after employers.

""Nazi card"" <-- See what Hotubjoe said below.  (Thank you Joe).  To add to this, the tactic they are using is a waste of money.  Who harasses a 10 year old girl on public taxpayer money?  Ridiculous and if you cannot see that you have some serious thinking to do."
"How are you still writing biased anti Trump BS articles ? Are children and SJW reading the Globe & Mail ? You should be ashamed of

"The only way it is homophobic is if the gay population took it to mean that Donald Trump is actually gay & they found it insulting that Colbert would lump him in with them for a laugh. But as a joke for those Americans who do not understand, it implies that Trump is Putin's b***h. And that remains to be seen. Money buys a lot of things."

"Some children are strong willed and need that extra control! I didn't need one with my other two children, but my youngest son was a different story. I used to think it was silly when I saw parents putting their children on a leash. That was until my son tried to dart into a lake. It was the best decision I could have made! It's unfortunate that anyone would verbally abuse a parent for trying to make sure their child was safe. I guess you are damned if you do and damned if you don't"
"God's children are killed all the time in US military actions - now that's hypocrisy.

Obama didn't bomb for many reasons, one being the complexity of the situation in Syria.  Trump just bombed Assad,  the enemy of ISIS, - the  terror group he campaigned on eradicating.  That's not just hypocrisy, it's stupidity."
"And if Wente had actually ""read"" the article, she would have found out the study compared Seattle to a 'Synthetic' Seattle of different areas of the state. Further, another study (using a different 'Synthetic' Seattle) came to the conclusion that, for restaurants, the increase had little effect. 

And the authors of this other study had criticisms of this study. So the study's conclusion is hardly a slam-dunk. 

But we still have the usual crowd predicting doom-and-gloom. 

But then these are likely the same people who predicted a jobs boom when Ontario lowered its corporate tax rate to be the lowest in North America. (We're still waiting on that one, aren't we?)

Liars figure and figures lie."
If you think this kind of garbage is good for kids or for anybody for that matter you deserve kids that this produces.

"What if President Trump is playing chess, as in getting China to finally act, which I think is the real purpose towards what he and his administration are doing, and all  the commentators here can't see past their nose and are playing checkers? I always bet on the billionaire, every time vs the masses, they didn't get to be billionaires by being stupid."
"I would like to remind you that the people responsible for 9/11 were deep believers in god and full of spirituality.  I'd also like to remind you that violating many of the 10 Commandments is punishable by death.
To credit a non-existent entity as the source of all good and evil is ridiculous and irrational.  A belief in a ""god"" does not elevate your moral character nor give you the right to claim superiority or justify your moral worthiness while implicating that non-believers are evil.  Can you think of a better way to insult non-believers?  Atheists have no choice but to shrug this nonsense off.  Religious people would like to ram it down our throats as an act of righteousness."

"Wow. You're delusional. TAFY's job isn't to investigate or judge the homeless. If it was, no one would ever come to them. Their job is TO HELP THEM. Oh.. and this may come as a surprise to you as well, but they're also not out there to get you. Amazing that the world doesn't revolve around you isn't it?. Really, if anything it's the other way around. Your group constantly targets individuals and groups they don't like, attacks them with lies and slander, and then cries and pretends to be the victim.  Hey, if you want to be a vigilante group and take the law into your own hands at least own up to it. Stop pretending that your mission is to help anyone when it's to make yourself feel superior by looking down on people less fortunate than yourselves."

"I would like to take Robin Brena's argument one step further and say that ""all the oil belongs to the state of Alaska"" and we should have an arrangement with the oil companies that recognizes our ownership by giving them a cut of 20% of all the oil they produce on ""our land"" while we keep 80% for ourselves. Instead, as Robin so deftly pointed out, the arrangement is exactly the opposite of what it should be; the oil companies are giving us a ""small cut"" of our oil and keeping the rest for themselves. It makes us look ""PRETTY STUPID"" and that stupidity is not lost on the oil companies. We are basically GUARANTEEING the oil companies survival while at the same GUARANTEEING our bankruptcy. Now that is REALLY STUPID!"
"I think it's pretty reasonable for this type of talk to emerge given what's just happened the last week. Elway has never fooled around and goofed off when it came to football. He makes his decisions and he expects a player to give 100% effort just like any GM does. It's obvious that Lynch wasn't setting the world on fire like Sloter did. It's all about mental toughness from your number 1 position. So far I don't think anyone can say that Siemian isn't showing this toughness. We all saw it from Sloter. We caught a few glimpses of it from Osweiler in his first starts as a Bronco.Can't say that Lynch has shown any signs yet, but to be fair he has pretty high expectations. Sometimes players lose that mental edge and hard to get it back in focus. In my eyes Lynch lost confidence when it wasn't happening and coming together for him. We'll see if Owsweiler can answer the bell if he gets called upon. I liked Osweiler, but I knew that I didn't want Elway to overpay. Houston was pretty dumb."
"But he didn't.
Neither did the other hundreds of mass shooters.

"This is the stupidest thing ever. Enforcing that federal law will cause more tax money being spent and fill up prison for what? People smoking marijuana? People die in thousands every year cause of DUI but yet hey it's making money so they don't care. Our prisons are already overcrowded and now to fill them up even more with a victimless crime. Enforcing this law and leaving it as a schedule 1 is going to create more of a black market and money will go to criminals instead of creating BILLIONS in tax revenue eventually right now it is in the 100's of millions easily. Next with everything going in the US and crime like in cities Chicago, are they really going to devote more money and law enforcement hours to stop what? People smoking a little weed?! All that happens is they get hungry laugh and go to sleep. While cocaine being in schedule 2 is way more addictive and has way more negative effects. This can create 10s of thousands of jobs. It can help cities with the tax revenue."

"Duvenage is clearly ignorant of the subject matter under discussion here. How he moved from anti e-toll specialist and advocate to anti nuclear power lobbyists baffles me?

That's the nature of our democracy where laymen and idiotic journalists become instant specialists in disciplines that take years to acquire the basics.Let Wayne tell the South African public who is funding his activities as he has become a full-time anti everything South Africa. 
Now to the issue of the nuclear power and the decision by the th western Cape High Court. The High Court in the first place overreached its mandate. Governments all over world sign bilateral agreements with other governments all the time. These agreements are mostly principles and intentions and by no means binding. And since not binding they are not subject to legislative oversights. These bilaterals do not involve financial commitments or obligations.The court judgement is therefore hollow"

Disgusting that this nation installs the identical regime as the heir apparent to Nazi Germany following the same game plans for a new Fuehrer trained by a jewish traitor, Roy Cohn, with Mein Kampf as the textbook.  Evil personified in a German-heritage traitor bred, born, and developed by the New York Wall Street traitors before and after WWII to install the same in this nation.  Nixon and Reagan blew it, Bush/Cheney set the stage, and the final solution was installed by the Republican Party traitors composed of the Billionaire Barons enriched by the Military Industrial Complex led by Oil Monopoly traitors.

"Mr. Wohlforth's commentary appears to suggest that Alaska Natives are nothing but poor innocent victims of a racist justice system. His tone is extremely patronizing and I wonder if he is playing the ""white man's burden"" role here.  This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth. Nearly all native inmates I encountered at ACC West, knew wholly that they did wrong. Funny thing about native people are that they are extremely honest folks, even when they did wrong. More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations. Maybe that is where Mr. Wohlforth should take a look at."

People react or in the Charlottesville incident, shout at the vile , dangerous Nazi sympathizers. There is no left leaning violence or hate involved here. It's a natural , cultural and iminient reaction to hate and the resurrection of what happened in Germany in the 1930's. This reaction is unfortunately the only way to snuff out this terrible movement. Trump is culpable. He encouraged it and this movement enables him."
B.S. Barn fires are devastating to farmers and they don't mess around with the prospect of their animals being killed in a barn fire. Farmers no matter how big are not cavalier about losing everything even if fully insured by barn fires and it is ridiculous to suggest otherwise.
"You are right, I'm glad that it was Trump who sent those 59 missiles into Iraq, that sure sent a message...Mess with the Bull, you get the Horns, and hopefully the Arse stays out of it...#MAGA"
"“The media and I often seem to be talking past each other; I truly hope that one day (soon hopefully) the members of the media will recognise that my intentions in every portfolio I have been assigned to have always been to elevate the work of my ministerial envelope to coincide with the needs of the people and the processes of a modern, sophisticated government.”

So it’s just the media that are misunderstanding her...... How tragic! And all along we’ve thought she was a thief who repeatedly screwed South Africans. How dumb we all are!!!"
Item # 1: get rid of this ridiculous civil comments crap.
"The fools promoting illegal aliens should be arrested for conspiracy to commit a crime. How is planning to shelter illegal aliens any different from planning a bank robbery. Come on EPD conspiracy is conspiracy.
Were there any children present? Planning a criminal act with children present should be child endangerment."
Could we please get pictures of the race baiter haters as a reminder to who are making ignorant comments like yours and ........
"I don't go to Fox, I don't go to Breitbart, I don't skim those check stand magazines and I don't believe anything I see on Facebook.

My point is that there is no difference in validity between all of those and  that Kristof is seriously worried about those which are making money for someone else.  

""Some of the people promoting these sites aren’t even conservatives; they’re foreign entrepreneurs trying to build websites that gain a large audience and thus advertising dollars""   ""While the business model for mainstream journalism is in crisis, these alt-right websites expand as they monetize false “news”""

As far as 'entertainment' is concerned, you need to get out more; there are an astonishing number of idiots and morons out there who actually believe that tabloid stuff at the check stand!  Hillary promised an Area 51 visit to placate some of them, remember?"
"This is quite a pathetic  ""belittle thy neighbour"" piece of commentary Hirsch."
"I agree with nigelnigel: ""Trump seems to want a war with N. Korea""
And you're cheering from the sidelines while swallowing whole the stupid notion that Hillary Clinton sold uranium to Russia. She didn't.
Every time Trump gets in hot water, his groupies whine about Hillary."
"Frank, thanks for your heart felt comment, I suppose his grieving family appreciates your smart ass, rude remark."

Donald Trump is a childish belligerent buffoon entirely without any credence.

Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda (web version) — Indivisible Guide

"We have ""sort of"" been at war against ISIS for a very long time.  Is that OK with you if we try to defeat enemies who blow things up, kill innocent bystanders they call infidels, chop off people's heads, rape and mutilate women and young girls, etc.?  I mean, they don't live in one country that we can declare war against, but is it OK if we go after them anyway?   A long list of civilized countries lauds Trump's retaliation for a crime against humanity.  Obama was too chicken to do it, or perhaps he was sympathetic with murderer Assad."
"When you have a chronic liar as a president what do you expect. Up is down, down is up and nothing has any weight. We are all in trouble since Republicans do not care at all and think its all noise since they are in power.

Yellow and Red make orange!"
"Non disclosure agreements are common.  I am all for removing it so long as ALL non disclosure agreements in ALL walks of life are also voided. As for truth and integrity, let’s have Trump produce his tax returns,eh?

You confuse an individual with CNN.  An individual, who is a paid political pundit gave information, but CNN. Honesty and integrity would be a good starting point, so try making real valid factual arguments. Pretty please? You know who else claimed fake news whenever anything else was bad?  Who else essentially delegitimized the media to rise to power?  Yeah you know who, another German just like Trump.  Your acceptance of his claims as facts despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary is sad.

When a website contains obviously partisan articles, or an article begins with an outright falsehood (to name 2 of snarky’s Links) they become unreliable. Sorry, but reporting facts you don’t like don’t make fake news.  Claiming opinion pieces are factual news is simply stupid."
It looks like Rex Kramer 99 is NickNaylor/retireeFinally/LukeCanada with the assistance of a spellchecker. Wait until he gets really wound up and starts spewing his ugliness.
"Wehave a p&$$y grabbing pedophile as the president, what is a little assault compared to that."
"The fact this state is 95% Donkeys in charge and can't get anything done is INSANE.  Might as well get rid of the state Reps and only have senators.  We waste so much money on INCOMPETENT elected officials who do NOTHING...  
Hawaii sure needs some serious help !"
Liberal activist judges overturn the will of the people yet again.  Shut up slaves!
"Really?  How old are you?  I have been to Puerto Rico numerous times and even hired people from Puerto Rico.  I am not an expert, but I do recall over the past few years that Puerto Ricans tried to assassinate President Truman, shot up the Congress and wounded a few Congressmen.  I recall those perpetrators being released and having a parade in the Puerto Rican neighborhood of NYC.  I recall them being hailed as heroes when they returned to P.R.  I also remember well that there have been three elections in Puerto Rico.   The people had a choice of becoming a state (This would have required them to pay federal taxes.  They never paid a cent.) or to vote Independence or to leave things as they are (Get all the free stuff and benefits from the U.S. just as if the whole island was on federal welfare.).  And you think we have ignored P.R.  Hell man, they drove out the Navy which provided Billions to their economy and thousands of jobs and we ignored them?  What a misinformed fool you are."
They're not in it for the long haul...most will be dead or in jail soon...
That one was ugly.
Surprised someone hasn't kicked in his teeth and dumped him in a hole. The NHLs most famous troll.
…people who denigrate any American's right to protest are nothing more than cretinous unpatriotic boors.
"(1/2) Oh, my dear Veritas 101, your post displays some pretty astonishing logic errors.  First, if the children had been my own, I would have (a) been grateful that they survived their lack of bear-sense, and (b) used it as a teachable moment regarding sharing space with wildlife.  Side note:  my kids were raised in the Bush and were taught from a young age how to be safe when in bear country.  Next, you make the leap of suggesting that those of us who advocate using good bear-sense do not take the incident seriously.  Again, this is a faulty assumption.  As Mr. Sinnott points out, this was a defensive action by a sow protecting her cubs.  It is that risk that prompts so many of us to urge all people choosing to use our amazing trail systems to be vigilant, attentive to surroundings, and alert.  Having raised teens and taught hundreds more, I suspect that these four were not applying those basic behaviors.  That doesn't make the kids bad, just foolish."
"Republican or Democrat, these are Texans, and anyone who has spent any amount of time in TX knows what that means.  There is nowhere else you'll find the level of compassion, selflessness, and community service that Texans embody and practise.

Quit politicizing this, you mongoloids."
This guy is a dick.
Much rather tell people I'm from Hawaii instead of Texas.  WTF!
"So you are an experienced liar. I imagine you were trained to lie to suspects and even regular citizens. 
Cops have lied to me on numerous occasions. 

I am  not sure what kind of weird point you are trying to make. 
Do you want people to like the police so they lie less? 
Maybe the police should stop beating people and lying about it. 
Maybe police should not show up at lawful protests with military gear they are not trained to use.
Maybe the police should have the attitude that their purpose is to protect and serve. 

I have never respected the DPD as a whole. I have seen too many unnecessary beatings by them.
When I was young and frequented lodo, I would cross the street if I saw Denver PD. After seeing a fireman beaten for asking why his friend was being beaten, I realized that they all can not be trusted."
"I am glad someone brought some common sense to the table , we were making fun of that whole group. Your making Americans look even worse! Sometimes you have to make the right decisions. Its hard,  but know when an ass is an ass!"
"Ironic how the same people that are so quick to decry bigotry are in turn so quick to label those groups with whom they disagree (But alas no, Trump is white just like his bigoted, fearful, xenophobic supporters)."
I am bitter - I am working so they get a free ride.  Seriously.?  Immature and weak he is - let's toss him out of office in 2019.  Arrogant he is.
"Final? Sure. But Punishment? Nope.
Suicide was the easy way out for this scumbag."
"You sound foolish, regardless."
"If somebody produced a video of Trump performing a sexual act on Putin you'd claim it was faked...
Such is your blind belief in the snake oil salesman..."
"""Hyperbolic nonsense"" is precisely what Trump uses to dupe the ignorant and desperate, and frighten the vulnerable."
Two losers.
"Well I don't think you see further attempts to discredit her because she is a fringe candidate that stands no chance to raise money or votes.
Frankly her association with Hales doesn't bother me at all; it's her inability to articulate her ideas during the debates.  And that she doesn't really have the experience or extensive background to be a mayor.
Oh and some really stupid tweets alienating white males, because the solution to that is a a white female... not experience, a plan or ideas beyond a couple hot button issues that are not unique or viable.
She's no Jules Bailey (who is also unelectable!)"
"People who support Sanders don't use words like 'guvernmint', expect the government to pay for their car stereos or their homes. What Sanders people support is for the conditions that have permitted the domination of the political system by the super rich to end. Their domination has effectuated a transfer of wealth from the majority of Americans to themselves. A candidate that is serious will attack these scumbags from all sides and take not only their power but also reduce their wealth which will keep their excessive greed and power in check. The super rich are a threat to the majority of Americans who are only a job or a paycheck or two away from living on the streets. The super rich view working people as their slaves. Eventually, the slaves will rise up and eliminate the slaveholders."
"Correct, I don't see them complaining that 11 out of 13 players on each team in the NBA are Black. Racial inequality is ALL in the mind.  For goodness sake, we just had a Black President.
The players message should be: ""DON""T BE A FOOL- STAY IN SCHOOL"". But, they have NO message. NO solution to their imagined grievances.
And, of course, they never tell other Blacks to stop killing each other. Blacks killing other Blacks is epidemic proportions.
Over 3,000 Blacks have been shot in Chicago alone this year by other Blacks.  I suppose it is somehow the White man's fault too."
"It is all fake news!  If you hadn't heard, there is no truth to the professed interference by the WH in any FBI investigation.  Someone is putting out all of this unverified information to create havoc and it seems to be working for the lefties are jumping through their butts and eating up all of the BS.  Have at it and enjoy the special of the day.  Idiots and naysayers, all nonproductive and waste of paper and print.  Money making project for the MSM and their left sloped groupies.  All the psychs need to examine their own minds before making any analysis of the POTUS mental condition.  The smell of the stench coming from the left is totally unbearable and putrid as usual.  When will will they ever learn to take the loss and move on like adults instead of acting like a bunch of over privileged lids with their hands out.   Need to get the belt out!   Maybe that will work?"
"I know some low level individual will be charged with something, that is what happens with these special counsel/special prosecutors situations. These corrupt politicians will have to get their pound of flesh before this nonsense can be put to rest. Hillary is big part of this nonsense, her losing the election is what brought on this false narrative of collusion. Had she won, we wouldn't be hearing anything regarding the Russian hacking, because Russians has been trying to influence our elections for decades."
"""Cant"" - hypocritical and sanctimonious talk, typically of a moral, religious, or political nature.
Sounds about right"
"Kathleen, I guess you haven't been paying attention to this issue. Let me sum it up for you. The legislatures own legal council said the governor was in his rights to expand Medicaid, but the Republicans filed a suit anyway. Then a lower courts said the same thing. Now the Republicans are appealing it to the Alaska Supreme Court.  You do know Albert Einstein's definition of insanity, don't you? But I guess it's easier to be insane when your not wasting your own money to prove your insane."
"How can anyone disagree with you?  Horgan and Weaver are Regional at best, neither are fit to run a province.   And this is just the beginning, they are already attacking the oil sector and going after the Site C Dam.......they don't give a crap about how many people they un-employ outside of their bubbles...........hell they won't even come to see what they want to shut down.  Completely unfit to govern."
"Obuma loves to hear himself talk, he was neutered in the last by election for gross incompetence - Trump is the outcome 

Yes Obuma states blacks MUST vote to keep his legacy alive - oooops, they even stayed at home! 

The Democrats look like fools on all fronts, what a bunch of soar loosers."
Ruth if our cheap fn politicians would stop sending BILLIONS overseas and start treating the mentally disturbed we will continue to have these problem. And I will never get rid of my AR-15 and will always carry my .380. You see i'm handicap and will always be easy prey for the thieves and lowlifes out there and I have only one question to these lowlifes. Can you outrun a bullet
"So adding ""too"" will make the concept more acceptable? If I say ""I have an idea!' does it mean that I think you have no imagination or that I'm smarter than you? The nexus is, the phrase Black Lives Matter was coined because it appears as though there are some who think otherwise. Those who wish to play semantics can hang on to an imagined slight or oversight. In the meantime, we watch the latest videos of  black men being shot..."
You have to be a special kind of stupid to fall for this crap. People still fall for the 419 scam as well.
"Yup, the LG would go against precedent and call for a $40M election redo when she has another obvious option. 
Then she'd head for the nearest fallout shelter and hope to stay there for 10 years or so. 
I can see that happening. Suuuure.
And Brexit: the brits made a stupid decision but they made it. They'll live with it,  so how about you let us live with ours - Clark out and a NDP government with Green support."
"When you have 18 year old students attending high schools that also have students as young as 13 in the same building you have a problem brewing. Yes the teachers will tell them to take their joint across the street but that's the end of it. Kids smoking, drinking and taking other drugs is bad enough. To legalize this gateway drug is just stupid.
Teachers will have no recourse when a stoned kid(s) sit in class."
"How do these fools get elected? An impeachable offense must be cited and evidenced, He has not done either of those things."
Hypocrisy at its finest. Has been going on for years. Anybody still wonders why the Middle East is so screwed up.
another useless piece of dribble by Gerald Caplan
"Trump is proof that the criminal justice system is broken and favors white men of privilege who commit sex crimes at will. He should be in jail facing charges. And not surprisingly, 73-percent of Evangelicals are for Trump. Go figure."
Personally stoped reading this article when he said growing marijuana is just like growing tomatoes... There's a lot more to growing pot then growing stupid tomatoes... Personally hate tomatoes and think we should out law them who's with me?
"What's the difference between an attorney and a carp? One's a mud sucking bottom feeder and the other's a fish.

Oldie but a baddie. The truth of brings a little tear to my eye. If I had a good personal injury lawyer I could probably sue the joke writer for damages"
"Darn leftist political whimpiness: Now airlines do not dare to react properly and give the boot in the rearend to foul passengers, and the subhumans get not dealt with properly ."
"If appears that if you disagree with a left-wing commentator, you are automatically labelled a racist and a troll."
"Anti-cop Obama excused BLM, and actually hosted them at the White House multiple times.

He even defended them at the FUNERAL for the five cops killed by a black nationalist in Dallas during a BLM anti-cop protest.

And he pushed the fake ""hands up dont shoot"" meme during the violent Ferguson riots, which his DOJ actually encouraged.

But in your world those disgusting actions should be considered noble."
Problem is the world is tired of hearing what the corrupt USA will allow and won't allow.   Why do you think the imbeciles in N Korea are doing this in the first place.   Try looking in the mirror you stooge.
We are falling into the rhetoric of the US  left / right dichotomy and the press does nothing to discourage this. Foolishness.
"I do not support the majority of Trumps budget cuts. I would however like to point out that our city utility rates, electric ,water ,garbage, sewer have continued to rise despite the fact something approaching 25% of our City residents need to access these federal funds every year to keep from sitting in the dark without heat and water during the winter every year. So even though our city council knows full well many of us can't pay these ridiculous rates without assistance they raise the rates over and over and count on the government bailing out the people they represent. I wonder what the city plan is going to be if these funds are discontinued and about a quarter of our town is dirty, sitting in the cold and dark next winter ? New art downtown , another pat each other on the back feed  at the crab house, how about some attorney fees? Any of you council members need legal assistance for stupid? That ought to pep everyone up"
"I have been looking at topless magazines and pornography since I was a young boy. Boobs are sexual and provacitive. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading this shit. These women and supporters are looking for every angle to protest equality. Men and women are created different. Equal and different. I'm a 30 year old male. The way women dress in our society already has me breaking my neck and ""objectifying women"". Put a nice set of boobs in front of me and I know I'm going look and think sexual thoughts. Without that intention even. The woman in the article stated women should be able to be topless because men can do it. What is being eluded to in the comments about the nature of men and the way we are wired. Is that we see boobs, or tight cloths, and our minds shift to wanting said ""object"". The sexual urge takes over. My point is this is not about inequality. This is about our physical anatomy being different. Have some morals. Making men wear shirts is more logical than this B.S."
"Maybe if the “voiceless”, as you so euphemistically refer to them, weren’t so busy robbing, assaulting, and murdering other “voiceless” people, their interactions with the police would be more pleasant.  This whole inane protest is based upon a foundation of lies, beginning with Mr. “hands up, don’t shoot” himself, Michael Brown.

While I have no doubt that the players do not think of it in this way, they are essentially protesting for the right of violent criminals to resist and/or assault police officers without consequence.  Nearly every recent example that has undergirded the “Black Lives Matter” agenda has involved a completely justifiable police shooting.  In only one example that I can think of, the one involving the man on the street in New York City who was suffocated, was there any reasonable question about the actions of the officers involved.  Also frequently ignored is the fact that in some of these cases the “evil” officers were themselves black."
"The high prices are driven by the corruption of the McGuinty and Wynne governments. Ontario had ample electricity supply for the forseeable future. We did not need a single windmill or solar panel and we certainly did not need to enter into long term contracts at ridiculous prices with a bunch of liberal buddies.
The question now is how do we get out of these contracts and reduce electricity rates. Could these contracts be bought out and the windmills shut down.
Wynne's attempts to hide her stupidity and corruption by hiding the real costs or renaming themdoes nothing."
But does he understand the bigger picture? All this will do is hurt US sales overseas in the large expanding markets. That will have massive problems for cash flows and shareholder value causing capital to leave the US. Something it can hardly afford. Trump is a fool catering to his stupid base.
"You REALLY need to spend some time doing some research, instead of spitting the kind of vitriol such as you have dispensed here. If you were being raped by a man who was overpowering you, would you prefer the cops use a taser or a gun?"
Make all these idiots pay the cost associated with this. Make them clean up their own mess & give them a big fine. Why are we letting these people just do as they please. It is definitely sending a wrong message. Wake up you dumb politicians.
I'm not aware of Jesus forming close friendships with or condoning the behaviour of adulterers or  homosexuals. Can you provide citations?
"you would think a ""science teacher"" would have the proper education to understand that since these clowns have shut down logging it has ran our schools into the dirt in lost timber revenue. You would think this clown would have the education to understand this has placed a huge burden on home buyers, and in our outrageous property taxes this has created an emergency poverty, affordable housing crisis. No wonder Oregon public schools are an international embarrassment. Look who is teaching."
"""...We did so most recently in April at the solemn events in France to mark the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge...""
Nothing to be pride here Canada.  Was it because Canada was invaded by a foreign country ? Of course not ! It's more that Canada was a boot-licking colony for the British!
Canada will not become a “real country” until YOU stop being a boot-licking colony !"
"... triple tinfoil layer hat wearer huh ... buys the cheap stuff, THINKS that more layers offers more 'protection'

I know the kind ... Wisconsin has all sorts of dingbats like Debbie Downer."
What a jerk!
"Try getting a decent job with a prostitution charge on your record. Two different standards, one for the police and one for the rest of us. Hypocrite."
What a mess was down town when all this happened. Seems with all this high Tech stuff that the idiots doing these calls would be tracked and caught.
"The candidate for the position is of Persian heritage.  Warren is an ideological bigot, or racist, or both.  Perhaps mostly the former, but I don't rule out the later, either."
"I was a R voter for over 30 years. No more. You lost me in March and I cannot believe people would pin their hopes on a racist, child molesting con man. I willnever vote for such man. There are good third party candidates if you can't stomach either candidate. But I will never vote R again over this betrayal of values."
"Angler Bob --> Cui Bono? Your comment is ambiguous. Where do live? Do you cycle? Are you affected by errant and wayward cyclists? We are, on a daily basis and if there are trouble makers, which there, we need a way to identify them, such as a description of a license plate. Not all cyclists are law abiding, accountable, or even nice for that matter, some are even rabid in behaviour. Do you live in a city? Where was this approach tested? I personally think you are full of kaka."
"You're a troll faking someone else's account.
Get out."
"""Lee was against slavery.""

No, Jo.  Lee was FOR slavery.  Why do we know this?  Because he fought to preserve slavery.  Does not matter at all what Lee said.  What matters is what he did.  Lee was a traitor of the worst kind.  A monster."
"I guess trump's campaign strategy of ""GRAB THEM BY THE P***Y"" was not the best idea after all..."
I'da knocked that bitchout cold. She would have let go.
"Yeah those Leftist Marxist Anti-Fa's
Boy,

"There goes Andy....the let me tell you troll, liking his own comments again......trumpy went after the uneducated, hilbilly, dullard vote and got Andy."
"Wait lists are unfortunately a fact of life. My only advice is go to the provincial wait list site and get your doc to send you to a hospital that has a short list. If its hip you may wait 18 months at Toronto Western but 90 days in London.
Also talk to your doc about a Cannabis or more accurately a CBD oil (drops) script. It will help with pain and inflammation but won't generate addiction issues or the dozy-stupid feeling of an opiate"
"This is clear proof that Trump is insane.  Neither Oregon or Washington are up for grabs.

He will be totally wasting his time coming here.  Trump's campaign is doomed."
This clown trump is a complete incompetent IDIOT.   He makes w bush look like a  Rhodes Scholar.
Chuckie Schmuck at it again. Another of HiLIARy's playmates can't handle the truth. Born loser
Ridicule is not persecution. Ridicule is simply the the involuntary and unavoidable noises reasonable people make in response to indefensible bat shit crazy bullshit.
"To be perfectly clear, I do not support union rhetoric, politics or their bargaining methods, their lack of participation in the concerns of the real world or their ignorance of the consequences of their actions.

That being said, I support them in this case 100% and sincerely hope that they are successful in this endeavor  encouraging all others to follow suit.  This Criminiberal government should have been disposed of like the carrion they are, years ago.

All the best to CUPE, and may the odds be forever in your favor. 

PS. I really cannot fathom why there are still people who support this government in OntariOWE.  Hopefully, CUPE is successful in getting a conviction that may allow those Liberal supporters to finally see the carnage this crime syndicate has laid upon the good citizens of this once beautiful province.  Their argument, ""vote for the devil you know"" was the worst possible excuse imaginable for electing Wynne! Stupidity begets stupidity..."
"""one buffoon won't be able to kill it""
Not one buffoon, no - at least not by himself.  But he's supported by 52 buffoons/croneys in Senate, 250-ish buffoons/croneys in the House, and 63 million or so voters.  Together, they can do a lot of damage."
The loyal Brown Shirt paid by the traitorous American Enterprise Institute funded by the Billionaire Barons of the traitorous Republican Party spews his traitorous vocabulary of ultimate dictatorship over all human and civil rights.  Goebbels would be so proud of his spawn.
"“Now who do I blame?” he asked, pointing to the audience. “The people. A bunch of idiots following Pied Piper over the edge of the cliff.""

Probably not the way to endear yourself to the sizable Trump electorate in Alaska."
"More drivel. Jews in Europe are afraid, but they are not afraid of Christians. Not at all. They are leaving France and Belgium and Sweden because of the growing Muslim populations. Hate crimes against Jews are far more problematic in Europe than the cause du jour of the Press, Islamophobia. The populist parties in Europe are pro Jew and anti-Islam. They are the firewalls against increasing anti-Semitism, not the other way around. This stirring up of negativity by Sanders toward populist parties in Europe is predictable and I knew it was only a matter of time before he played the Hitler card. If the Jews are looking for politicians in Europe who have their backs, they need look no further than Oban, LePen in France, Geert Wilders in Holland and Nigel Farage in the UK."
Pretty pathetic when you must form a Union instead of having government make sensible rules to allow owners and renter to get along. You cannot expect an owner to rent out a unit at less than market value but rent cannot be raised in one year at a massive sum either.
"Because it was unfortunately just a crazy lady who sprayed acid at the girl's face, for no apparent reason. An act of violence is defined as terrorism when it is motivated by political aims, that's just the definition.
Everybody would be of course terrified to get sprayed with acid in the face, but it has nothing to do with terrorism."
Great post. So glad to see Thiessen and his racist buddies being exposed.
"What about vehicle theft? A person's vehicle is usually their second most valuable possession, after their home. They used to hang horse thieves but I'm hearing that under SB91 the cops can't take car thieves to jail unless they've done it several times. If true that's pathetic."
Skankles is leading the pack in lies. Don't forget Fornicator Bill.....it's a family tradition.
"The troopers are spot on with the spillover crime, and theirs more trash in Mountainview than all of Mat-su."
"The only thing I hear from you is hate, fumbling BS, and nonsense. Get a life or give it up."
That's all the liberal MSM is good for firing off relentless insults on TV and then whine and cry when they are insulted back. Liberal Hypocrites.
"The GOP has more pervs than any other party. I know the Dems have a few, but only a few."
"If Trump really is homophobic, xenophobic, a bigot, and racist; when is the men's march? 
And just out of curiosity, has anyone really noticed the way Trump supports his foreign wife, daughters, and jewish family members?How is it a march for women when you as women, ostracize the women who want to march for pro-life? So many questions!
I'm sorry, but it's just so Jerry Springer  to use the new president as a  scapegoat for all the things that were allowed to fester over the past decade. Why didn't anyone feel it was important enough to march for the cause sooner? Maybe you were hoping Hilary would come to the rescue? 
I for one happen to like men and I have three fantastic boys, so all you men haters out there sporting your pussy hats, try not to raise a bunch of men hating women. If you don't think it makes a difference, take a look back into history of infanticide and see what the outcome has been."
Reading these comments I notice Leitch and Trump drawing out the smelly bottom swamp creatures filled with hate and racism. These creatures need to be exorcised!
Useless. Pointless.
"What an absolutely ridiculous statement ""get used to disappointment from Trudeau""
Clearly you have no idea as to the amount of work and length of time these deals have been underway!
Why not learn so you can make informed statements rather that spewing nonsense."
"The same source of ""experts"" that conjured the 97% ""consensus "" garbage about global warming that turned out to be a heavily doctored ""survey"" of selected responses compiled by a grad student?
Maybe if Obama threw another $10 billion into their debt it would make even more idiots on the left and their historical think tank place him as number one.
Doubling the national debt in 8 years makes the clown an absolute failure trying to spend his way out of trouble like the village idiot we have presently destroying Canada."
"""Better than a dope fiend infested hotel.""
Yeah, keep repeating that and maybe somebody else will believe it."
Unions aren't the problem.  It's uneducated citizens who don't bother to attend board meetings but would rather sit back on their fat butt and Monday morning quarterback.
"The British will have no choice but live in fear for a long time to come. It would have been a lot easier to restrict taking in refugees, like the bomber's parents with questionable background."
There won't be life in prison if these thugs bust into my house.  They'll be dead.

Xbt don't hate the Chump just want a caring and compassionate president which he is totally incapable being. You on the other hand spew stupid and ignorant comments that is more evil than hate. Lack of empathy for human beings of all races is despicable. One day you will find yourself in a situation where you will be the minority and I hope that God will have mercy on your sorry s.
"Hey welcome back, Pocho wannnabeawhiteguy.  ""God bless the Donald?!!!"" WTF? Is that the best you can do.  So interesting you keep blaming the dems, when the incompetent GOP has controlled ALL legislative agenda in the House since 2010 and the Senate since 2014.  But we don't expect less from a willfully ignorant and poorly educated lapdog.  But please don't go away for so long this time.  We know that the country is on a downward spiral every time you, sparkleboy, Ronindotard, and the who pack of MAGAphants put fingers to keyboard."

"Dear Minister of Twitter (aka chief Twit)

Some muddled thinking there, bud , to say that it is not government that is engaged in corrruption, but corrupt civilians that work in government is stating the obvious - like saying guns don't kill people, people kill people, using guns as a method or weapon.

Where is you evidence that the private security industry is riddled with criminals, and if this is true, how does this compare to the level that SAPS is riddled with corrupt people?

In the last 4 years, 80 of your own ANC officials have been murdered in KZN, yet not one single arrest and successful prosecution has taken place - why not?
It is not difficult to draw up a list of suspects - start with their rivals and those that benefit from their demise.

Stop blaming the public for the fact that your Police force is so useless at their job, and politically compromised."
"Excellent Job Mr. Trump. You are making obamma, hillary and her followers look so foolish."
Don't forget 10 years ago r's had Boy George and both houses.  Two years later it all went D.  Don't be so naive.  Those that can't admit Trump is a wreck have their eyes and ears closed.

"The ""award-winning"" PBS Newshour completely humiliated itself, constantly demeaning nearly everything Trump did.  In particular, Gwen Ifill, Mark Shields, and David Brooks stated emphatically that Trump could never win, on numerous occasions.  These three proved themselves to be deeply ignorant and obviously uninformed."
"Hard to believe I voted for this idiot. While I still would, to get rid of the 'little dictator' from the lost decade, it seems we ended up with a Mr. Selfie and clued out shiny pony entourage. Mr.Trudeau,with all due respect,I didn't vote for you to continue Harper's sellout to Communist China and TFW slave labor programs here! I didn't vote for flooding the country with Muslim radicals! I didn't vote for the utter hypocrisy of foisting bogus carbon taxes while you continue to pollute the country on behalf of big American oil interests and China! At least with Harper,he was the fool you knew,not the idiot selling out his country to the lowest bidders and going in the opposite direction of our neighbours to the south."

I want these people's illegal fingers off of the fruit and vegetables that I eat, I want their illegal feet off of the manicured lawns that I drive by, I don't want to sleep in a hotel bed that has had sheets changed by one of these despicable criminals. 
I hope the Trump is successful in rounding up every brown-skinned laborer - I mean criminal - from Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador - every country south of the border - and I hope it's at a record breaking speed.

Over 4000 people come into the US everyday of those ONLY 196 were held and only 1 or 2 were held were held for more than 5 hours and than 5 hours and than ALL WERE RELEASED !!!!!!!!!!! WHA IS WRONG WITH MAKING AMERICA SAFE!!!! THIS IS NOT A BAN AGAINST ANY ONE PEOPLE !!!!! Go educate yourselves on what the ban truly is and stop your stupid protesting just for something to do !!!!! IF YOU CAN'T BACK YOUR PRESIDENT WHO TRYING TO KEEP THE TERRORISTS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY GO LIVE IN THE 3RD WORLD COUNTRIES WHERE THEY COME FROM AND MAYBE THAN YOU'LL GET THE POINT !!!!!!

"I agree that Trump is a bully, but then again so is China.  Maybe Trump's approach is the only sensible one given the current global context.  Someone needs to push back a little.  I'm not worried about ""consequences"", as I suspect China's bark is worse than its bite.  After all, they want things to work in the end, because it is in their best interest to keep things relatively smooth."

"Sorry fort the short reply. Long answer is that every murderer had a reason for killing. Voices in the head out covering up adultery,  it's all outside of my definition of dame. 

When someone straps a bomb to themselves because it's what Muhammad would do, they have been leg on that path but they ate insane. 

The congressional softball shooter was invited to his attempted murder by the #resist movement. Still, to take it offline required that he be insane,  in my opinion. I had a friend who was murdered and her murderer seemed have reasons that seemed to make sense to them at the time. 

Crazy is as crazy does."

WTF is going on here... its sex, nothing else... LGBTQRSVP people are not unique other than having abnormal sex. Its nuts."

"After this hotel is demolished, build another hotel with a 50-year warranty. Make it such that demolition is fast, easy, and safe.

Hotels are risky investments. Like marriage."

Reminds me of the sleazy Anchorageites who successfully lobbied the Assembly to let them throw their drunken parties and take over a small residential lake every weekend, making the actual residents miserable. Those Anchorageites were insufferably self righteous about their entitlement to trash a Valley neighborhood on the weekends with their equally sleazy friends. 

The Assembly took the side of the weekenders over the actual residents.

Step one: UN get your ass in there with an army and take out all combatants. Step 2: repatriot all the refugees back from all over the world to help rebuild the place. Step 3: govern country from the UN as punishment for not being able to settle your issues peacfully. Repeat this process whereever there are problems in the world. You want Globalization then this is how to do it.
"I don't know if the rat lung worm money was diverted as retaliation, but it's high time Tokuda is removed as WAM chair.  She has become arrogant, misusing her power and position for personal means.

She has no one to blame for there downfall but herself."
"All Christians, Jews and other religious denominations are angered and will retaliate every time another Muslim demand is made and honoured.     This is beyond ridiculous that Muslims are allowed to force their religion down our throats.   This is a very serious situation and there will be more violent attacks when our government refuses to curb this activity.   Muslims can take time from their days at school to pray, yet our Lord's prayer has been dismissed as being controversial.    Yes, this is going to get very ugly and could easily turn into civil war. That comment is not outrageous.  Muslims have come from that very climate and they didn't leave that on the shores behind them.   This is just the beginning of a rally."

Instead, he's really regressed the last 3 games.  I'm now ready to say it's time to give up on thinking he may be anything more than a stop-gap starter until we can find a true starter.

"Twitter and all these social media companies claim to be egalitarian and open to new ideas and democratic and so on - in true Silicon Valley ""saving the world"" fashion.  Actually, they are even more dangerous: globalized hard core capitalists who do not want nation states and care about the every advertising dollar even from terrorits, foreign governments etc.  

Time to regulate them like utilities and force them to crack down on terrorist content and foreign government intervention.  We don't allow this on radio or TV or by email - so why do these social media clown get away with it.

They are monopolists and nothing more.  Regulate the crap out of them.  It will save society."
"We shall see how powerless Schaltz and the democrats are.  Frankly they just need to sit back and watch the republicans destroy themselves.   All this might just change next year.  Republicans have a tendency to really blow it because they only care about the rich and no one else.  Why anyone would vote for such a bankrupt party is beyond me.  

Just remember it has been over 50 years since a republican president submitted a balanced budget to congress.  The real pathetic thing is that today's repblicans would never chose this president today.  How sad."

I don't agree that most of his supporters are deplorable so that I wonder how you can look past his immorality, racism, constant lying, blaming, inflaming hate, division and incompetence. He is an embarrassment to our country.  You seem like a good person, Como, so why do you insist on looking the other way from the truth of who tRump really is and unfairly (and stupidly) vilifying Obama or Hillary."

How about in 2018 we all get together and vote like it really matters to make the big changes to the congress that are needed to keep this country from devolving into third world status no matter how imperfect the Democratic Parties candidates may be. We don't get to have perfect in life and we have to accept that or more trumps will be in our future. Damn the speeches and damn the emails or whatever other else  the opposition conjures up to attack any candidate that is not perfectly left or perfectly right. We deserve better as a nation than what the current congress and president are delivering but conditions will only improve if we can move away from the quest for that state of imaginary perfection that no one has in reality. Accept that we can change this situation via voting."
"The NDP is disappointed..??  Really??!!  There's a Party that's sinking into oblivion under the weight of it's colossal stupidity.   Since the beginning of this century, one is unable to count on our hands the number of times that the NDP has supported the Conservatives only to have it blow up in their face.  The best one yet was when the Cons, during an election, brought up the niqab issue.  Mulcair gleefully waited for this to sink Trudeau..  24 hours later, Mulcair presenting a macabre smile, was trying to explain his position on the Conservative dog whistle.  Hey, NDP, Trudeau gave you a hand up with that weighted ballot..  but OH NO!  Let's join the Conservatives  and end up with shineola.  Stupid beyond belief!!"

"Trump is a scoundrel.  Conservatives acknowledge that.  Most progressives, however, simply refuse to acknowledge that Clinton has serious faults.  There lies a big reason for division.  Mainstream American culture has been under attack for 50 years now, and those attacking it now have the audacity to bemoan the ""culture wars,"" as if those making culture war on America are those defending it.  I'm surprised that you, Alexandra, would say such things as: ""[Trump] does not consider you to be a full human being, because [you are] a woman"";  or that his campaign was ""based on [lying vitriol.""  Apparently you missed Clinton's statement last week that if Trump is elected, it could well be the last free election in America.  What deceit and demagoguery.  As for shutting down news services:  what he said was that he would shut down the web in areas of ISIS controlled Syria and Iraq.  You, lawyer, know what misrepresentation by omission is.  There can be no unity with untruthful progressives."

"What did a semen-stained blue dress from the Oval Office have to do with a land deal in Arkansas? After a couple of years of digging, that's all a partisan prosecutor could find against Bill Clinton. 
There's nothing unconstitutional about a prosecutor working an investigation finding evidence of other, related or even unrelated crimes. And of course, it's constitutional to pursue those other crimes. 
Watergate started as the investigation of a burglary and led to related crimes that brought Nixon down. 
Say a judge signs a search warrant based on evidence of an illegal poker game in Joe's basement. The cops come in and find they're not gambling, but there is an ounce of cocaine on the card table. Do they walk out and say: ""Darn, too bad the warrant's for illegal gambling. Now we can't make a case for the cocaine.""

In fairness, I think the reason that the Muslim parents of a soldier who died in combat were provided a forum is to emphasize that not all Muslims are terrorists (just as all Christians don't follow Christ's teachings). Of course, the Khan's were speaking only to people who don't have hearts filled with hate and minds filled with Fox News garbage.

I'm sure you and the young women you teach rail daily against the Church's nice words that go nowhere—go nowhere with a vengeance."
"I hear you. Often such people you describe, many ex-Catholics, are so pessimistic about anything Catholic, that if given the choice of two evils to befall the church, they would choose both and hope for the worst. lol. They especially can't imagine Catholics who are highly educated and content with their achievements and faith. That would be an oxymoron, a mistake, a blunder, promoting a statistic that doesn't deserve a hearing. But such thinking is kind of mob-like, with hands to type and not brains, no balance. That's how I see it. And you are right, common folk are regarded as ""dumb animals,"" as it were, ""led by their pastors,"" ruined by the over-verification of parish bulletins or whatever. If I took this fume seriously, it would be purgatory. But I don't. Posting on a Catholic publication like this, ex-Catholics are often like little figures on a wedding cake arguing: no celebration allowed; just rant!

"I think what's being overlooked is that the Baptist schools aren't actually being accused of violating anyone's Charter Rights. The Charter protects against discrimination based on sexual orientation, it doesn't command celebration of it.

What should disturb people, is the government is stepping on the freedoms of Association, and Religion. Freedom of association cuts both ways: you can choose to associate with something, or choose not to. Other people can choose to associate with you, or not. Someone may want to associate with the Baptists, and the Baptists may choose otherwise. Within very broad strokes, the government isn't supposed to have any say in religion. You can't kill someone, then try to hide behind religious freedoms, for example. If they can make the Baptists violate their religious beliefs, they can make the Muslims, and the Jews, and the Scientologists. Take note, Atheists, they could make you pray."
Well the current situation is they are selling out to the highest bidder and that ends up with totalitarians or morons in charge.

"Donald Trump is spending this morning of his vacation lamenting the removal of various monuments to treason in defense of slavery:
One thing I’ve been surprised by during this slow motion car crash into a raging dumpster fire is the sheer depth of Trump’s stupidity and ignorance.
You could tell during Tuesday’s press conference that he thought he had come up with a new and especially powerful argument when he lectured the reporters about the previously unappreciated fact — no doubt just relayed to him by an advisor in the previous day or two — that Washington and Jefferson owned slaves (wait until he finds out that Jefferson liked to rape some of his).
On top of everything else, he’s just really really dumb — and of course he remains blissfully unaware of this."

They are merely pro fetus. They can all justify killing folks once they can breath on their own. Their support of the death penalty and the killing of unarmed people by the police show they are not pro life. Heck, there have been hundreds of folks on death row that were innocent. They don't shed a tear for those deaths."

So you stand for guests that enter your home (as do I).  That's good, because that's standard societal protocol.  To NOT do so would be disrespectful.  The situation for the national anthem is exactly the same.  Get it now?

As for the wholly unrelated stuff in your last paragraph, I'll bite.  Of course what Trump said about McCain (for instance) was more disrespectful. Duh.  It's also irrelevant to the issue of players disrespectfully taking a knee during the national anthem.  This isn't a ""which is more disrespectful"" game, it's simply establishing that refusing to stand when present for the national anthem IS disrespectful."

It is time for racist America to accept responsibility and be held accountable for creating a despicable racist monster as Donald Trump. The key to Trump’s rise to power is America’s pride of its slave days and the wanton killing of Native Americans of the American West.

What we see and experience today is part of that legacy. 

There is no other explanation. That legacy is here in Anchorage with the wanton killings of Native people  on our streets, run down like animals and left to die. It is in our cities by rogue hate cops killing black and brown people at will. 

Donald Trump, with all of his hate and bigotry, from his “hate Obama is not an American birther” days to his kick all 11-million Hispanics out, is your creation. I can only conclude that might include some of my Hispanic family.

And the white media? They all smile and laugh about Trump like high-school kids watching a school-yard bully."

As far as the ""As you know, we're under siege"" line ...We are under siege. Our election was compromised and we now have a president who believes it is ok to undermine and mock democratic (small ""d"") principles when he doesn't get his way. Leave it to Trump to make it all about him and not, hmm, the very fabric of our democratic ideals (free press, judicial independence, etc, etc). Also, those who claim to be ""socially conservative,"" but elected a Class-A pervert - not to mention a misogynist, a racist (check out his history) - to the highest office in the land means they are hypocrites of the highest order. They don't get to call themselves ""social conservatives"" anymore. Not with a straight face, anyway. And then there's the normalization of the alt-right, etc"
The Prime Minister is not surprised that his minister is caught in a lie.  It seems clear that the PM is happy to sustain the status quo and continue his leadership that supports liars and their lies.
So crazy. Donald Trump isn't anybody's pocket. Will take the country back from special interest groups. People! He IS the pocket and the special interest group. Everything you hate that politicians supposedly do for the monied class - HE is going to DO himself because He Is The Monied Class. Why can't you see that??

Best of all, in a strange way, was WWII, where we ALL pulled together for the sake of America.

At the same time, our town was probably a ""sundown"" town, as no blacks or other minorities seemed to live there; girls weren't encouraged to finish college or take most jobs; gays and lesbians, if we thought of them at all, were just ""queers"";  the environment was too often  a place to dump trash;  forests were overcut and not adequately replanted, etc.

So is life better or worse today?  That is a long and complex question."

Why would anyone think anyone could come in with zero experience in politics  and be successful is beyond me.   The Donald is truly an embarrasement.  We will probably lose our leadership role in the world to China and perhaps Russia.  Sad.  

I was not a Hillary supporter but I voted for her as at least she knows what she is doing.  The Donald acts like he has no clue most of the time.  What an embarrasement.  A real shame that republicans have no leaders like Eisenhower.  Hell even Nixon and Dole have been rejected.  Pathetic."

"What a terrible example of corporate entitlement!   Delay these bonuses....ridiculous.......they should be cancelled immediately.  Any managers at Bombardier before the provincial and federal bailouts don't deserve any monies for their poor performance leading up to this situation and any managers brought in subsequent to bailout funds should be realistically rewarded since they decided to join a ""chronic bankrupt government charity case"".  Pierre Beaudoin being given any money is pathetic, and if it weren't for his family's dual-class share structure, he would have been fired years ago.  This mess is 100% his responsibility.  Unfortunately, this dual-class share structure continues and in turn, the Beaudoin/Bombardier families ability to blackmail our governments, and in turn, taxpayers.  Too bad that Ottawa and/or Quebec cannot ""nationalize"" this economically important enterprise and end this corporate governance blackmail."
"All of the hysteria from the left about starting impeachment proceedings immediately is one example.

The two previous Presidents who were impeached actually did something first to start impeachment.  The only thing Trump has done is win the election.

Colluding with Russia?  Still not one shred of evidence of any wrong doing.  Obstruction of justice?  No evidence other than Trump expressing a ""hope.""  No one in history has been impeached over expressing a hope.

The Left's constant banging of the impeachment drum is the exact thing Dems worried Trump would do if he lost.  Refuse to recognize a duly elected President and threaten our democracy by doing such. 

The Left likes to scream that conservatives (or Trump supporters) are Fascists, yet the left are the ones using the tactics of Fascist Brown Shirted Nazi's to shout down conservative speakers or conservative student groups.

We may look back at this shooting as a Ft. Sumter moment when things turned bloody in this civil war."

In the end liberal ""choice"" amounts to two things:

1) The right to an abortion

2) The right to be gay

They don't believe you have the right to choose your own health care--and so on it goes.  Liberals indeed detest choice because they detest freedom.  They prefer government control."

However, you seem dumb enough to have enrolled at Trump University, so maybe you did advance beyond grade 12.  One other point.  Private citizens get passes all the time.

"It certainly seems to be true that many people are troubled by the changing world. In the US election, they voted for Trump, when it should be obvious to them that he is a fraud who will never (yes, never) do anything to help them. The times, they are a changin'. If you don't want to evolve with them, best get out of the way. My biggest fear is that Trump, in his childlike stupidity and obstinacy, will blow up the world."
"Erdogan is one of the world's thugs.  In the company of Putin, Trump,  and Orban."
"The church presents celibacy as a charism, a gift, given to certain members of the believing community as a witness oriented to the kingdom of God in which women and men will neither marry nor be given in marriage. 
The Sacrament of Orders celebrates and confirms the call of certain members of the community to celebrate the sacraments of the church with and for their sisters and brothers.
There is no logical or necessary connection between the two.  A person gifted with the charism of celibacy may or may not be called to Orders; a person called to Orders may or may not also be entrusted with the charism of celibacy.
The discipline that links the two -- that requires celibacy as a condition for orders -- artificially shrinks the pool of candidates for orders, and it disfigures the charism of celibacy. ""Mandatory celibacy"" is an oxymoron, if celibacy is understood as a charism.
Enforcing celibacy on a widowed deacon is simply, incredibly stupid. The bishop ought to be ashamed."

"And the best part is Obama and Bush carried out basically the same foreign policy of disastrous misadventures in the Middle East. Obama spent more and racked up more debt than all previous presidents combined. Race relations are worse than they were since the 1960's. His only legacy other than destruction of our influence and stature is a failed healthcare law which no one likes save a few true believers. All propped up by a dishonest and complicit media who can't criticize the first ""black"" president. These guys are still blaming Bush, who was also a nightmare."

So why is the RG just repeating WPost articles written for a paper (Bezos owned) that has an agenda? Do they not have the ability in a college town with a journalism school to ferret out real reporting?  Instead, the continual Trump bashing by an often paid segment of the population hosted from the East to the West coast wears so thin that it almost smacks of  yellow journalism.

"Trump's Labor Day Message To Workers:



 Screw You!

Trump’s Secretary of Labor, Alexander Acosta, has a miserable history of aligning with right-wing and corporate interests. 

Just weeks ago, he appeared before the annual gathering of the militantly anti-labor American Legislative Exchange Council—along with anti-union zealot Betsy DeVos, Trump’s secretary of education.

Trump’s pick to serve as deputy secretary of labor, Patrick Pizzella, has an even more troubling record than Acosta. A former campaign staffer for Ronald Reagan who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations, Pizzella was once employed by the viscerally anti-union National Right to Work Committee and later joined the firm that scandal-plagued lobbyist Jack Abramoff was associated with before his 2006 conviction on federal charges that included attempted bribery."

THANK YOU GERALD CAPLAN for articulating so well what really happened in this election. The ignorance represented in the American electorate and in many of the comments here is part of what's created our now disastrous reality. One in which a democratically chosen woman - who would have been an imperfect but truly great president - is beaten by an electoral system originally created to appease white slave-owners in the southern United States. Now effectively appeasing fearful white nationalists and internalized hatred.
"Blame the fat failure in the WH. Supposedly we are in Afghanistan to hep and encourage young women escape the heavy hand of the Taliban that holds women down and insists they NOT go to school. Supposedly we are there to help and encourage. Then the fat orange terd does this? WTH are we doing as a nation? No wonder the whole world is laughing at us and shaking their heads in amazement at how stupid and ignorant we are as a country. Trump is taking this nation into the twitter/sh!tter and we are, thanks to the obese orange sexist racist clown, the USA is circlin' the drain. And all his trumpanzee supporters are simply too ignorant and hell-bent on some sort of revenge against the black president to see clearly...color-blinded by our national pastime -- racism!"

I re-posted it; you'll find it easily enough. (On my display it appears immediately above your most recent post to me.)
Trump's presidency is disintegrating in full view of the whole world, and his personality with it.  
Which version of the Comey story do you believe?  Trump made Pence, Sanders, and Conway look like the idiots they are for working for him.  He sent them out to lie for him on one day, and then pulled the rug from under them the next.  These folks (and of course Spicer, too) will never fully re-build their reputations; Trump has ruined them. 
Trump has lived a filthy, dishonest life personally, professionally and politically. Why would anyone think he would, or even could, be different as president? Lock him up."
"Indeed.   Just think of being in the graduating class, and after years of study, having to listen to such self-absorbed claptrap from the ""leader"" of the country.

"After last night's admission that he may not accept the results of the election, it seems rather obvious that Trump planned on losing all along - that his bid to run for the highest office in the land was nothing more than a reality-show ruse to launch Trump TV Network after the election with his new, built-in base of alt-right Breitbart readers to add fuel to the fire. He'll even keep Steve Bannon on to run the show, merely stamping the Trump name onto the new venture like he does all those buildings in New York in which he has no real financial interest at all. As with everything else about Donald Trump, it's all for show. There's no there there. He's become nothing more than a tacky franchise.

I have to wonder how his loyal band of followers must feel knowing that they've been played for fools and idiots. If they haven't yet figured it out they're more foolish than I realized - and that's saying something!"

Eugene Robinson is a genius next to you. The main investigation is of the Russian interference in the last election. Comey said that it s a fact, and that it ""went all the way to the top"", meaning Putin. Trumps connections and transactions with Russia, which we know are many, will be investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller, and neither you knor anyone can tell at this point what they will reveal, so the ""crap"" is coming from you. At this point we and the world know that Trump lied to us and then lied about lying. That's no surprise. It now seems likely that we will see Trump's books for the first time since 2008.

"""so obviously its not religion thats the problem"".   Definition of naive.  I know you would like to think that but this is not only about the terrorist attacks, it is about culture.  Their religion does not like our culture.  They do not like gays, they believe women should be subservient.  Pew polls suggest that while a small minority believes in the violence (still a whoopingly high number in absolute terms), they do believe cartoonists should be killed if they portray mohammed.  And they also believe in Sharia law.  Overtime you see a muslim leader or Imam get questioned they say ""Islam"" is a religion of peace, but push them on Sharia, women and gays and its all double speak and changing the subject.  Plus, where are they when these things happen?  I rarely see any news stories of large swaths of muslim sincerely renouncing these atrocities nor do I see them doing something about it day to day. You would think the left leaning media will be all over those types of stories."

"It has to do with Tyranny of the Majority.  It's not acceptable for the majority to infringe on the rights of the minority or an individual.  If it were, we could hold referendums on all kinds of ridiculous things.  As soon as it appears someone's rights have been infringed upon, whether it is by a tyrannical monarch or a majority vote, it becomes a constitutional issue.  Hence a constitutional lawyer.

For instance, we could hold a referendum to:

1) Take your house away and give you nothing in return.
2) Throw you in prison.
3) Deport your entire family to North Korea, except for your dog.
4) Let Justin Trudeau adopt your dog and rename him Justin Jr.

If we achieved a majority, then we could just point at the referendum and strip you of all freedom.

As silly as these things are, the constitution is what protects a tyrannical majority from infringing on the rights of the minority.

I am not saying this is anything more than NIMBY, but if it is, then we have a problem.  Make sense?"

As a bonus the citizens now have true skin in the game and pay much closer attention to the spending than ever before.

"BS.

Trump himself said he fired him because of the ""Russian thing"", and the circumstances leading up to his dismissal (seeking his personal loyalty, asking him to lay off Flynn) leave little doubt.  

Earlier  efforts to say Trump fired him on the deputy AG's recommendation were denied by the deputy AG. 

Saying Trump fired Comey because he was unfair to Clinton during the election is just plain laughable."
This crooked criminal thug got off very lightly.
"That is ridiculous in so many ways that there isn't room to reply adequately.  To begin with, have you ever been to private schools?  And you are lumping in the few private academies with private schools located in many typical neighbor hoods through out the city.  You are also putting typical liberal stigma on blacks and other minorities that they all live in poor neighborhoods with those like them.  I guess my nephews black wife, who grew up in a south suburb wasn't informed that her family was in the wrong neighborhood and needed to move to Montbello.  I suggest you go to Lincoln Academy and see the cross-section of society that attends there.  In the end, you are so narrow minded on this subject that you can see through a keyhole with both eyes."
"I listened to Ted Cruz on FOX news.  He, like then other clowns in the GOP, still claims that Obama did not have the right to make a nomination becasue there was an an upcoming election.  He had no way to explained how that is not in the Constitution or where in the Constitution Obama's presidency ended before the next president is inaugurated. I'd sure like to see this BS present to SCOTUS.   I have no doubt they would be telling the Republicans a president's term does not end until inauguration day. Ted Cruz,  the self proclaimed Constitution scholar, what a joke should represent the GOP. I'm sure the judges would laugh him out of court. .



Using the same Republican idea that there is an election coming I'd say it would be reasonable for Democrats to demand a judicial nomination by Trump is wrong and it should be made by the next president in 2020, Sorry conservatives you started using this idea so it should apply to Trump as well."
What a ridiculous response.

The RCMP are right to insist that the children leave. It has nothing to do with residential schools etc, just common sense. The rain showers we had this a.m. are just that and won't have a significant impact on a large fire. This is just the start of the fire season and these fires will be a threat for a long time."

The bottom line of Trumps speech is an indictment against the party of progressive democrat’s and their elitist entitlement leaders. Of course the progressive left is upset with Trump. But even with all that Trumps speech points out as an indictment he didn’t do near the damage Wikileaks did in releasing emails from top DNC officials that show the inner workings of the Democratic Party aiding the Hillary Clinton campaign to defeat Sanders during the primaries. Secondly the now unquestionable evidence by the FBI director that Hillary Clinton is indeed a sociopathic liar. The Progressive Democrat party is dead they just aren’t intelligent enough to realize it as yet.
"First of all kudos to all them that served and are serving. With the highest respect for all. However when is someone going to tell the truth. Granted there was a draft in that war, but the newer ones relied on a feeling. Its called patriotism. This word, or feeling is a money maker for the real people in control.   If you cant control your feelings you may get in trouble. What is really going on? The Bushes and others sold a line of crap, men died and were maimed. For What!  A feeling!! We only think we are free. Those in controll laugh at chest thumping studs. The real money people dont let their kids join. How many deferments did they get from nam, then they are suppose to lead us! How stupid! Then you have a terrorist like Obama, who in there right mind would give a plane load of cash to Iran. A fellow terrorist would. That money is now working against the patriots Im talking about. Again kudos to the brave men & woman of our country."

"J Hamstra,
 You basically parroted the approach of the article. I posted the partial validity of it. Are you acquainted with the Kohlberg model? You post about ""rare occasions"". In life  and at church it is less rare. At a place of work the motivations are pay and being fired. SDA are worldly, insubordinate rebels. Why do you think preachers keep presenting sermons urging bible study and proper Sabbath observance..etc. Sermons are basically chew out sessions and inept shallow religious therapy sessions..
Also think of where Jesus said to the disciples, I no longer call you servants but friends. He is alluding to internal motivation.
The SDA denomination needs a wake up call & reality check. Members will continue to be Laodicean lukewarm losers as long as pastors & leaders are satisfied with ""playing church."""
"I don't understand why Dr. Carson continues to support Trump.  His behavior and conversation are what one would expect in a barroom, not from a  presidential candidate.

On the other hand, Bill Clinton got a pass, in spite of numerous allegations of sexual misconduct by several different women.  And then there was the racist LBJ . . . . .

There seems to be enough hypocrisy to  go around, along  with plenty of evidence of a double standard."

"I don't know whether transgenderism is a mental affliction or a physical one,  but either way, it is a condition that will require years of medical treatment to ""cure"".  We don't allow people with club feet or rickets to join the Infantry, since neither can walk the walk without large amounts of medical intervention.  We don't allow allow diabetics to join,  nor those with other diseases or conditions, because of the increased medical care needs that detract from their ability to perform active service.  It seems reasonable to prohibit known transgenders from enlisting to prevent the long term and expensive medical care they would need in order to perform their duties."

2. Take the blame for his whipping up racists with his rhetoric, and promise to change his ways. 
3. As gesture of good faith and show he means it, fire Sessions, Gorka, Bannon and Miller.

"The Fedlibs have 17 seats in B.C., most of them in the Vancouver area.  They have 4 seats in Alberta.
Political calculus would suggest Trudeau, with a knowing wink to whoever is running B.C., will abandon his constitutional responsibilities and passively allow KMX to be asphyxiated.
The immediate outcome of this will leave Rachel Notley, fresh from fitting Albertans with their carbon tax hair shirts in a naive search for ""social licence"", looking like a fool and being thrown out of power in 2019.  Other consequences for Alberta, B.C., and Canada will follow.

Christians can be extremely irritating, and downright stupid sometimes, but then again so can many non Christians, in all sections of the community you will find idiots, even the Atheist community. I agree with you that one does not have to be a Christian or a religious person to be charitable and generous, in fact many non Christian folk put Christians to shame in this area. You took an extract from Mathew 6 regarding praying in public, nice, try Isaiah 45.7  ""I form the light and create the darkness, I bring prosperity and create disaster, I, the Lord do all these things"" He acknowledges that he is responsible.

They waste fuel, energy, food etc - and don't care about conservation and recycling. We are #1 country of losers and abusers. Low quality costs more so we need more credit cards to buy more junk and waste."

"Your people ignited WW1 which caused the deaths of over 20 million. In the more recent past You've killed many Slovenians, Croatians, Bosnians, and Albanians. What is it with you war mongers?"
"Um, incorrect. There are, in fact, independents in the Senate. They caucus with the Democrats. 

I think you are the one who doesn't know how the senate works. 

And it's been said before, but this inane ""seniority"" argument didn't come into play for Ohio Dan so why drag it out now? We all know that it's BS."

I saw Trump's tweets come up on my feed this morning as he posted them and just could not believe it. It's beyond idiocy, the guy is losing it."

"Sigh.  Human Rights Tribunals don't 'convict.'

If you don't like a decision of a Tribunal, you can apply for judicial review. 

If you refuse to pay the money they order you pay the complainant, you might have your wages garnisheed or your office furniture sold.  

If you refuse a direct non-monetary order of any civil court or tribunal - after exhausting all avenues of judicial review and appeal -  yes you might be found guilty of contempt, and, who knows, it might lead to jail.  It's called the rule of law and it applies to any of the thousands of different types of tribunals and civil courts in Canada.

If there is a trial for contempt, it will be in a court, and will use the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

I happens rarely in Canada.  The only one I know is a Terry Tremaine, who had been posting the most disgusting hate against  ""persons of the Jewish faith, blacks and other non-white minorities"" and continued posting it."
"JSelover, what a smart remark indeed, good for you.  Do not judge me or my skills, shame on you!  You keep looking at the eyes only and enjoy life!  I think however my skills are more than adequate; I do think I have the right to voice my opinion without getting nasty."
"I'm imagining two evangelical Christian law graduates, each holding the same views on sex and marriage. The first grad comes from the U of T, the second comes from TWU. Their qualifications to be lawyers are equally shining. However, LSUC might accept the first but would automatically reject the second. Why would LSUC engage in such discrimination? Because it disapproves of a discriminatory rule at TWU.

I get it that a portion of LSUC's membership wished to make a political statement on TWU's policy. And had it just been a statement, no harm would've been done. But now harm is being done. It will be up to the Supreme Court of Canada to determine which harm, TWU's or LSUC's, is the greater.

LSUC has tied itself to a position that is legally and ethically questionable, if not hypocritical. They'll be lucky if the Supreme Court bails them out of the mess by ruling against them."

""" McCain is one of few Republicans willing to stand up for the American story.""  Unfortunate that Brooks couldn't resist partisanship.  It is that very partisanship that provides the foundation of our currently dysfunctional political environment.  McCain is an American first, a republican second.  Whereas Brooks is apparently the opposite, i.e. a democrat first and an American second.  It is hard to imagine how the modern liberal came into being.  The liberals who view Americans first as members of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender groups rather than as simply Americans.  The modern fake liberal is death to universality and solidarity.  Some day they will have all of us fighting between our little perceived groups, white supremacists, white males, feminists, blacks, illegal aliens, gays, and the list goes on.  Identity with the little group rather than as Americans."

Pointing out that cops stop people who match the description when searching for someone... is biased? Or are the cops biased? Should they not be searching based on physical description? Maybe they should just search by asking people their names. If they were looking for Patrick Cho, who do you think they'd stop and question? The irony of your last sentence is astonishing. It would be funny if you weren't quite so sanctimonious in your opinion of yourself."
You got to be a young white female....not young black female to get DA's sweetheart deal!! Her victim may yet live but he will face hard time ahead. I bet she will do far heavier time then the previous two cases where the victims died but the female white preps literally walked!!

No. quite silly actually
"Well Richard,

His skin color has everything to do with it. When he was elected for his first term ,all of the racist came storming out of the closet and haven't turned back. If you can't see that, then you are one of them. Obama didn't fail at anything, it was all hate from day one. He kept his cool, so he'd not be labeled the angry black man, and the I told you so crowd, couldn't say 'see what I mean'. Like AKJammer first instinct was to blame Obama for something he had nothing to do with. If it wasn't for all the hate, Obama would be labeled the G.O.A.T. POTUS!"

"You demanded facts: 
From Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom is a Legal analyst for NBC News and Avvo, attorney and bestselling author.

""In our nation’s history, so many of the sickest most appalling crimes have been committed by whites. Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."" 

Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.

Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.

Wait, there's more. Cheers."
Quit defending the Orange Cheetos Sweeney. It' embarrassing enough that he makes up his own stats but then to have someone try and echo his stupidity is just crazy. Next YOU will telling us about the mass terror attacks in Sweden as a result of immigration.

He was forced out of his own country .  As opposed to the tens of thousands who want to flee to other countries because they are too coward to stay and fight for they're own homelands. I'm not talking about the women and children---but those over 18 years old who are cowards . Thank goodness American's aren't cowards or the German flag could be standing tall on our homeland.

"To get a good idea of disaster situation is like,  turnoff your iPhones for a month if you can last that long.  And for an actual disaster situation go live with the homeless for 4 months leaving everything behind.  that is in a tent.  I don't know where they take a shit so I can't tell you.  Look around and what ever the homeless do of find water is what you going have to do too.  Be prepared for no fresh water for about a month or more since homeless going be in a disaster situation where even no more supermarkets to shop at much less no more money.   yes no toilet paper.  So live with the homeless should give a lifetime of actual situation we live in today. and oh yeah.  store some blue tarps,  buy one honda generator now."
"I don't believe that Charles Dalton has ever posted that no black person can be successful or ever has been because of white privilege.  If fact I am 98% certain he has not. It seems you have to lie in order to make your dubious point. In fact, I find you more of a racist than Charles, since you yourself have implied that Charles's success was the result of affirmative action, rather than his own talent."
"This insistence on referring to those who are in loving same-sex unions as sinners is truly bizarre.  In the times of Jesus, lepers were considered to be such.  Thankfully, we have evolved past that.  Is it not high time that we evolve past this idiocy of considering persons who are in same-sex relationships as being sinners?"

"Sounds  like the words ""legal immigration"" still have no place in your vocabulary. And 20 other countries built walls are now trying to stem the invasion from the Middle East by Islamic hordes who never even consider assimilation. The refugees of war and military age with no wives or children  continue to invade, as has the onslaught by Islam on Christian lands, for the last 1,400 years. I am thankful for my relatives who fought these Islamic animals for over 250 year in the land of the Dragon."
"Does he even know the definition of ""oath""??? He's a narcissist. They are in their own world and will never believe or listen to anything or anyone about anything. Lying is a way of life.

"Nobody cared about the Census but the majority are disgusted by the Kadhr issue and won't forget that Trudeau gave 10 million taxdollars to a terrorist when the court did not even order him to do so.

"I wonder aloud why minorities are so over represented on CNN. Charles is a far left leaning black bisexual. That is precisely the opinion he brings to both his written op eds and his commentary on CNN. Don is a black homosexual, who is always giggling about how weird he thinks the POTUS is. And before you paint me with the homophobic brush, I think Anderson Cooper is a terrific journalist, and someone who might be fun to have a beer with."
The mainstream Jewish organizations were trying to kiss British ass.
